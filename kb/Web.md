Hello everyone, welcome to yet another session on Gupshup conversational
plus stack. Today we\'ll discuss on how brands can leverage web as a
channel in their overall omnichannel strategy. So once you are logged in
on the platform navigate to channels. Under channels, move to web. And
here, you can see you\'ll find a URL. So once you have created a journey
on a on the platform under Bot Studio, in Bot Studio basically under
user journeys and you clicked on save and deploy, you can simply embed
this particular URL on the web page where you want to basically activate
this bot. So this is basically where, like there is a installation steps
here as well. You simply have to embed this URL. Now, you\'ll see two
options here: settings and test. Settings are basically where you want
to configure the bot, and there are multiple things that you want to
activate on a bot. I\'ll start with chat aesthetics. So this is where
you basically configure look and feel of the overall bot. So you can see
like there are multiple options available here for brands, for example,
bot name. So whatever bot name you will give here, you can see in the
preview. Okay, then comes to bot avatar. So there are multiple avatars
available here, and you can upload if you want to like upload another
like custom avatar, and you can see the avatar will be displayed here.
Now, colors. Under colors, you can choose various colors. Like header
color is basically where you can see like at the top right what should
be the header color. You can configure background color of the chatbot
message color. Like you can see this color you can give to the bot
reply. You can configure color for a user message, like you can see on
the preview here. Similarly, you can set font. So, there are a few
styles which come out of the box, and even if you want to give choose a
custom style, you can do that by giving font family and font URL. Okay,
and then you can configure chat widget. So you can choose whether the
widget should be small, medium, large. What should be the position?
Should the icon of the bot should appear on the right or should it
appear on the left etc.? Right? You can choose the icon. So here, you
can see, right, there\'s icon selected here. Similarly, you can choose
the size whether it should be small, medium, large, etc.. Right? So
these are the configuration that you can enable on the UI piece. Then
I\'ll move to greetings where basically you can configure the greeting
message from the bot. For example, here you can if you want to choose,
you want to put some image, you can do that. And then you can basically
write a custom message. Okay. For example, I\'m writing to Gupshup. And
if you want to like have buttons on top of it, you can do that as well.
For example, \"interested,\" \"show more,\" etc.. Right? So these are
basically the greeting message that the user will see once they want to
like start a conversation with the brand. Right? Now I\'ll move to
pre-chat form which is basically the first thing that the user will see.
Okay. So you can enable that. So there is a button here, and these are
basically you can see as a use case you can like take it as getting
consent from the user. Okay. So for example, once users wants to chat
with the brand and you want to get a consent, you can have a pre- chat
form here where you can upload an image. There\'s a placeholder for
that. And then you have a header where you can basically write something
in the header section. Then you have a subheader section where you can
write about, for example, consent information. It can be as simple as
that. Okay. And then you can configure checkbox text which is basically
this particular section where you can give a text. Then you can give a
hyperlink text here and then the URL for that hypertext, where if
somebody wants to like, for example, here, in terms and condition, you
can see that there is a hyperlink you can activate. So if somebody wants
to go and read terms and condition, which is redirection to a website,
the user can do that. Correct? And then there is a global button text
which is basically here, for context in the preview, it is \"get
started.\" So this is how you can configure a pre-chat form. I\'ll move
to the persistent menu, which is basically main information of a
business is a main menu, right? So here, you can see, right, I have
configured a reply button and a URL. Similarly, like there are two
things that you can add to a menu: it is either a reply button or a URL,
and that will be persistent here. So if somebody clicks on
\"interested,\" you can basically have a payload here. Okay. For
example, this one, and you can trigger a journey on top of it. And then
you can have a URL where which is basically a redirection. Okay. And
then there are some preferences that you can store. For example, you can
enable or disable customer chat history. So if you want to retain
customer chat history, you simply have to enable this feature. Okay. And
then there is some security checks that you can enable. For example, if
you want to restrict the messages onto a whitelisted domain you simply
enable this toggle and give the domain. Okay. So, for example
console.gupshup.io can be a subdomain, right? So it will whitelist
everything that comes under gupshup.io. Okay. For example, this is a
website that I want to whitelist. So I\'ll give like console gupshup.io.
I can add it. Okay. So the domain is gupshup.io which has been now
whitelisted, and I can click on save and save my preferences. So this is
how you can control not just the UI piece of the overall web experience,
but you can control security preferences persistent menu, and so forth.
Right? So this is where you control the overall chat experience through
Gupshup Conversational Cloud. So that\'s all about this session. Thank
you for joining. See you in next. Thank you.
