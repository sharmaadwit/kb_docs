Hi, welcome to a short overview over agent assist. Now in your chats
that you are building on the Gupshup Journey Builder, you are able to
actually go ahead and connect a user to an agent at any point during the
interaction, during whichever node that you wish to go ahead and lead to
an agent.

## Agent Transfer Node

You can simply click the add button, go under actions, and one of the nodes is the agent transfer node. The same node can be accessed
by menu on the left where you have the agent transfer node available. If
you want to pass on any parameters, you will be able to go ahead and

## Queue Tags / Team Routing

provide tags to help with the queuing of the particular chat to the
right team. Now once we're done with this, we move on to the agent
assist part where under chats we are able to actually see any chats that
have been assigned to users.

## Agent Views

You can create views which will allow
agents to go ahead and filter and see the relevant chats accordingly.
Now if a chat has ended,

## Re-initiate Chat via Templates

the agent does have the choice to reinitiate a
chat by sending a template. These templates can be approved as per your
requirement. There are only the relevant ones visible to the agents to
send across. Once I click on send template, the message would be sent to
the user who once replies is where the chat would become active. So here
we will just simply have the user respond to the chat, and as you can
see over here, the user has gone ahead and said "hello" and the chat is
active. Now there are a lot of interesting things you can do in a chat.

## Canned Responses & Attachments

If you hit the slash key, you will be able to go ahead and use the
canned responses which can be used to quickly get the message across to
the user without the agent having to type them. The agents can actually
provide attachments to be sent across. They will be able to add smileys
to the response, and all of these options are optional. Of course, they
can do audio notes, and they are able to go ahead and send users across
to a bot journey as well. Now apart from that, the response itself is
something that the agents can go ahead and finesse a little by either

## Rewrite/Expand/Rephrase

pressing the expand key, which will quickly make the message a bit more
finessed than it was otherwise. There's also an option to rephrase which
can provide you alternate views of how the message can be written
instead. Now before I actually send the message, I might want to know
what actually was happening in the previous conversation. And that's
where the

## Chat Summary

chat summary is something that can help the agent understand
the customer's purpose. If there were bot responses, it will be able to
summarize the same, and agent responses as well. On the right-hand side,

## User Details Panel

the agents should be able to see details about the user, including their
number, their email, and other details that are relevant as a part of
the account. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the short and sweet
overview of the Agent Assist module.
