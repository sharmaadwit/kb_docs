There are major configurations that are also present on an\noverview. So based on the business goals and requirements, we can\nconfigure these as well in a very quick fashion. Now, towards the left\nhand side, we have the rest of the components which includes assignment\nrules, chat rules, agent status, scan responses, views, chat fields,\nfeedback forms, etc., which are gathered into separate modules over here\nfor better understanding and analysis and setups. Now, with the user\nmanagement module, we'll be able to invite the users, edit and delete\nusers, add users, etc., based on the new passwords and everything. So we\ncan add those users which are created to a particular team based on a\nregion, based on time zones, based on subject matter expertise, etc..\nAny kind of agent status that is required, for example, if a person is\navailable right now, unavailable, busy, etc., can be configured, and you\ncan create---these are some of the system default ones---but you can\nalso create a new status request according to your requirements.\nAutomations work efficiently with respect to the agent assist\nenvironment.

Today we will be looking at the\nlatest features of AI Admin. So whenever you want to create an\nArtificial Intelligence workspace, we click on Bot Studio and then we\nnavigate to AI Admin. Over here first of all all of your previous\nworkspaces are visible, so either you can click and edit any one of","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/AI Admin.md"}},{"id":"kb/AI Admin.md::chunk::1","text":"## Workspace & NLU Management\nthese or you can also click on Create a new workspace from scratch. Now\nI have just for the sake of demo, I already have one workspace created\nover here, so let\\'s walk through this. Over here we have five to six\ntabs seven to eight tabs and then we can also change this workspace,\nrename it and click on save. Then just to explain these tabs, intent is\nsomething intent basically refers to an action that a person would like\nto perform. Say for example a person saying I want to book a hotel room\nin Delhi for two people on this particular date. So booking a hotel is\nan intent and all the property values mapped to that particular intent\nlike which hotel, which particular date, how many rooms, how many\npeople, all this is referred to as entities. So an intent is an action\nand all the properties related to that intent are referred to as\nentities. You can click on Create intent, you can give it a description\nand then you can also generate utterances which is being generated by\nAI. So if at all I write I want to book a flight and click on Generate\nutterances, it basically will generate multiple types of examples in\nwhich I can ask to book a flight. Then there\\'s one as soon as you train\nsomething in the content section, one intent by itself gets created by\nits own, which is referred to as FAQ. So if at all you\\'re creating an\nFAQ bot, you don\\'t have to create intent for FAQ. It\\'s already there\nby default. If at all I click on entities, over here you can create\nentities which are mapped to those intents. So if at all I click on\nCreate, I can give it a name and description and then I can map the\nintent to which I want to to whichever I want to map it to. Say for\nexample in additional parameters I can also enter sample values or\nalternative values just for better training. So that is also a\npossibility.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/AI Admin.md"}},{"id":"kb/AI Admin.md::chunk::2","text":"## Content Training & Scrapers\nIf at all I click on Content tab, this is where you can train the AI workspace in multiple formats. So either you can also click\non any one of these URLs, click on Enter and click on Save and train.\nYou can also define to what extent do you want to scrape this URL to. Do\nyou only want to get it trained on the provided page or should it be\nunlimited depth or should it be only seven pages. You can also train it\nin the by train it in the form of PDF, TXT and CSV files as well. Or you\ncan also put out text input. So in this case just for example I\\'ve\ntrained it on short input on some text on based on Indian heritage. Okay\nand I have trained it. Teach this is where you can teach your bot\nmultiple utterances just for better training. So just to explain this\nparticular concept, say for example there\\'s a new joiner in your\noffice, in that case you can you train them by you know telling them\nthat in various types of situation examples ways a question can be\nasked, right? So teach is nothing but that. So if at all I click on\nTeach sample, this is a a sample CSV file in which you can train the bot\non sample utterances. So you can simply give it a question number, you\ncan give it a name and you can also map the intent around it and you can\nalso map the entities around it. So this is very less used but still\nthere\\'s an option for it just so that you can train it by uploading a\nCSV.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/AI Admin.md"}},{"id":"kb/AI Admin.md::chunk::3","text":"## Evaluation & LLM Settings\nThen we also have Evaluate. So if at all you train the workspace on\nany content, so you can also evaluate just and this is basically the\nevaluation of accuracy. So this is one of the workspaces that I already\ncreated. So if at all you click on Generate Q&A via prompt, over here\nyou can simply enter the prompt that tell me about the stock market\ncourse. So it will generate five to ten whatever the number of question\ncount you enter over here, it will generate those number of questions.\nYou can then refer to those questions and decide whether the accuracy of\nthis workspace is acceptable or not. So say for example I click on this,\nthis is a these are a few set of question and answers that I got\ngenerated just to define the accuracy of of my training. Over here I can\nrefer to all these questions and I can define whether this is acceptable\nor not. Then we also have settings with regards to AI Admin. So I\\'ll\nswitch back to this tab. We also have settings, so if at all I click on\nEdit settings, I can also export and import entities and intents. Which\nis again very less widely used but we still have a functionality for\nthat. So all these intents these are majorly created through the intent\ntabs and entity tabs but they can also be exported or imported. Then you\ncan also enter workspace instructions for answers whether these should\nwhether many emojis should be used or not used, whether the answer type\nshould be short or long things like that. And then we also have LLM\nconfigurations for responses. So if at all I click on this, there are\nthe four versions wherein we are using different combinations of open\nLLM APIs just to create different types of workspaces. And then we also\nhave setting up selection of answer type whether it should be short or\nlong and then we also have precision threshold wherein you can define\nhow confident the bot should feel before it answers any question. Say\nfor example if at all this precision threshold is switched to 90 and you\nask an agent a question, in that case the agent will not respond to that\nquestion until and unless it is 90% sure about about the answer. So it\nis that\\'s why it is generally kept around 30 just so that the bot does\nnot become too much strict. And then we also have language settings and\nthen in developer settings, this is where we have a workspace\nconfigurator just for additional flexibility.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/AI Admin.md"}},{"id":"kb/AI Admin.md::chunk::4","text":"## AI Agent Configuration (Personality/Skills)\nAnd then finally the this is one of the newest features in AI Admin, which is the AI agent tab.\nThis was previously in beta and now available on console. So over here\nyou can now create your own custom AI agents workspaces by yourself. So\nwe have four tabs in these AI agents. Okay first of all you give it a\npersonality, if at all I click on Edit, you can give it a name, you can\nchoose the behavior whether it should be professional and positive,\nclever and playful, respectful and persuasive or empathetic and\nsupportive. So whatever is whatever suits your use case best, you can\nselect any one of these. And then you can also choose the language style\nwhether it should be straightforward, sophisticated or technical. And\nthen whether the bot agent should use ok emoticons frequently or never\nor occasionally. In this case I\\'ll say frequently. And then you can\nalso set up a custom greeting message. This is the first message that\nthe AI agent will send whenever a customer says hi to it. Now in the\nsecond tab this this is where all the use case orchestration in done for\nAI agents. In my skills if at all I click on Edit, you can give it a\nname again and then you can give it a description wherein you can enter\ndescribe your use case in very short words and then the AI will generate\nutterances for itself. So in this case I say you are an FAQ agent which\nhelps users by answering queries based on Indian history. Okay as soon\nas I click Generate instructions, skill objective, engagement rules,\nguardrails, tools, this is these are all the tabs were filled by the\nagent itself according to my intent, according to my description. Now\nagain I can click on any one of these and I can review all the prompts\nthat the AI agent wrote for itself. And then I can tweak if at all I\nthink there might be any changes required in any of these prompts, then\nI can do that. In a very simple language I can also enter all the\ninstructions that I want. Say for example I can say always answer in a\nvery humble manner, right? So in just in similar ways wherein you\ncommunicate with your friends, you can simply write give instructions in\nthe prompt editor to the AI workspace. There\\'s no strict format that\nhas to be followed. So just to walk through this as well. In skill\nobjective you can actually give the agent its personality what actually\nwho actually the agent is. In engagement rules you can actually define\nin what manner should the agent engage with the end users, right? And\nthen we also have tools wherein any kind of operation that needs to be\nperformed, that is done via tools. So in structured journeys we do API\nintegrations and in AI agents we have tools, okay? So tools are\nequivalent of API integrations. So you can write any tool to perfo","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/AI Admin.md"}},{"id":"kb/AI Admin.md::chunk::5","text":"agent its personality what actually\nwho actually the agent is. In engagement rules you can actually define\nin what manner should the agent engage with the end users, right?

So tools are\nequivalent of API integrations. So you can write any tool to perform any\nkind of a function, say for example you\\'re collecting some information\nand you want to send it to some CRM, a tool can be used to do that. So\nand let\\'s also see how it is used. In this case I\\'ve written use\n\\@get_faq_answer_tool to fetch answers from the training data. So this\ntool basically performs this particular function that it makes the AI\nagent fetch answers from the training data. I can also say use\n\\@search_api to fetch answers from the open web in case not found in the\ntraining data. So any any kind of instructions related to tools can be\ninput over here. And then we also have a skill completion criteria\nwherein you can define the goal of the agent as well. So if at all I\nclick on edit, this particular workspace will get saved. Now\nadditionally we also have we also have a separate tab for tools. So\nthese are the few tools that have been generated by default. Then I can\nalso click on add tool, give it a description and we also have a a UI\nwherein you can enter the API endpoints and write the code for it. So\nany kind of use cases which requires any custom development on tools,\nthat can also be done through the console itself. And then finally we\nhave settings wherein we have four four options over here. So this is\nwhere all the LLM configuration can be done and we can or this is where\nwe can also fine tune how our AI model generates responses by generating\nkey parameters like max tokens, temperature or top P. First of all we\nhave models so wherein we have two options, GPT-4O or GPT-4O mini. And\nthen we have max tokens, temperature and top P. So max tokens basically\nset the max tokens setting controls the length of the AI responses. So\nbasically a higher value allows a longer more detailed answers while a\nlower value keeps the responses short and to the point. And over here\nthe limit is set to 1000 which means that this particular AI can\ngenerate fairly detailed replies within that particular limit. Then for\ntemperature this basically influences the randomness of the AI\\'s\nresponse. So a lower value like 0.1 makes the AI more predictable and\nfactual and basically it makes sure that it is sticking closely to the\nknown information. And a higher temperature closer to one maybe makes\nresponses more creative and a little varied. Okay then we also have top\nP this basically controls how diverse the","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/AI Admin.md"}},{"id":"kb/AI Admin.md::chunk::6","text":"ly detailed replies within that particular limit.

And a higher temperature closer to one maybe makes\nresponses more creative and a little varied. Okay then we also have top\nP this basically controls how diverse the AI choices of words are gonna\nbe. So a value of zero maybe means that it picks up the most probable\nword, right? It won\\'t be that much creative, while a higher value might\ninclude a little more variety. So let\\'s also once all of these settings\nare done and you go back over here there there will be an option for\ntesting the workspace. So in this case I\\'ll switch to this particular\nenvironment and if at all I go back wherein I have created this\nworkspace and trained it on a similar data. Now I can go back to AI\nagent, I can click on skills and I can basically write hi over here\nI\\'ll get my greeting message and then I can start asking questions\nbased on the use case. So maybe I\\'ll say tell me about the Indian\nfestivals. So now since this has been trained on a lot of text, it will\nbe able to send me out information. Now this particular workspace has\nbeen made and this can be now attached to any channel, okay? It can be\ndone on WhatsApp, web, Instagram, anywhere using the Bot Studio.

To set up an\nautomated campaign, we come onto the campaign manager and select\nautomated. Now you will see a few pre-approved templates like this.\nLet's say I select appointment reminder. I select this disclaimer\nmessage and I click on \"Use Template\". This is wherein you can select\nthe trigger. So, say for example in this case, it's going to be based on\na date property. I'll select the appointment date, or the which in this\ncase could be date, and then when should the campaign start? Should the\ncampaign start on the date, before the date, after the date, or until\nthe date property value? So, in this case, let's say since this is an\nappointment reminder, I'll say before the date property value. Two days,\nand at what time? Let's say I'll say 12 p.m.. When to repeat? Only when\nthe day and month value matches. So, in this case, if at all I have an\nappointment on the 15th, I'll get a reminder on the 13th at 12:00 p.m..\nAnd then I can select a template message, and I can select the template\nwhich talks about reminding me that I have an appointment in the next\ntwo days. So, this is how you can set up automated campaigns. Automated\ncampaigns can also be set up based on what somebody has done or not\ndone, wherein you can actually select an integration. Or you can also\nselect it on the basis of segment addition. Let's talk about both of\nthese. So, in case of integration, let's say if I scroll down, let's\ntalk, let's imagine that this is one of the integrations that we have\ndone, and under that integration, this is one of the events that has\nhappened, let's say sign up. Right. So, now each time a sign up happens,\nyou can send out a templated message to the customer. You can also\nfilter this based on based on the payloads as well, where attribute\ncity, customer ID, or birth date. You can simply click on one of these\nattributes and then customize it later on just for further filtration.\nIn terms of payloads, you can also set up a trigger as segment, wherein\nI can say customer 360. And, say for example, each time a person gets\nadded to a specific segment, you want to enroll them into an automated\ncampaign. So, how can we do that? We say, \"Select what someone has done\nor not done\". We select the source as customer 360. The condition is\n\"Added to segment\". I can click on \"Add Filter,\" and then I can select\nthe segment name like this. Now each time a person gets added into this\nsegment, a templated message can be sent out to this user. So, this is\nhow you set up automated campaigns.

Broadcast allows you to reach out to your user base using a\nWhatsApp template. So in four simple steps you can reach out to an\naudience by broadcasting a WhatsApp message. There are simple four steps\nwhere in you\\'ll give the broadcaster a name, you select a list of\naudience, you select a pre-approved template and then you schedule the\nmessage for a specific time. If at all I click on new broadcast\ncampaign, we also have an option for interactive, which is like a step\nup from your regular way of doing it, which is one way. In the\ninteractive campaigns, you can send out a WhatsApp message and connect\nit to a conversation on WhatsApp. So let\\'s say if there\\'s any WhatsApp\ncampaign with a quick reply button and if a user clicks on that button,\ninstead of just noting that value, you can also trigger a small bot\njourney and a person can click on any reply button and then start\ntalking to a bot which can lead to increased engagement. The idea is to\nconvert a one-way campaign into a two-way interaction.\n\nAutomated campaigns allows you to control all the messages that need to\ngo out in an automated manner. It is majorly used to support use cases\nlike payment reminders, appointment reminders, payment dues and all of\nthat. Where in you can click on new automated campaign, you can give it\na name, check the disclaimer. And this is where in you can select it on\nthe basis of a date property, simply select the date and you can define\nwhen should the campaign start. Let\\'s say I say on the date property at\nwhat time and whether should it repeat or not. So all the messages that\nneed to be triggered automatically can be handled using automated\ncampaigns.\n\nAny message that needs to go out to a large number of users, that\nmessage needs to be templatized. This is a policy by Meta. So the\ntemplate section is where in you can build different types of templates.\nIf at all I click on create new template, this window pops up where in\nthere are three types of categories: marketing, utility and\nauthentication. Authentication is used to cover OTPs, utilities are used\nto send out all the service implicit messages when you\\'re trying to\ngive updates regarding a service to a person, like hey your order was\ndelivered, your payment failed, your payment was completed, something\nlike that.

Bot Studio has several modules. In the\nJourneys section, this is where in you can build two-way interactions.\nThis is where in you can define the conversations, add block after block\nand define the logic what should happen in the conversations. If at all\nI click on this drop down, there are three types of journeys: user\njourney, campaign journey and ad journey. User journeys where in a user\ncomes onto the business number in such a manner and they say hi or a\nhello and then the bot gets triggered. A campaign journey is the one\nwhere in you send out a WhatsApp campaign and you attach a reply button\nto it and there\\'s a bot attached to that which is an interactive\ncampaign. So that is an example of a campaign journey where in a user\nenters the bot using a campaign. And then there are ad journeys in which\na person that comes across a click to chat ad on Meta or Instagram or\nGoogle, they can click on that ad and then they can get an option to\nsend out a WhatsApp message to the business and if at all there\\'s a bot\nattached to that conversation, a bot can start talking to the person on\nthe end. Ad journeys works in complement with click to chat ads, where\nin all your advertisements can be managed. So all the advertisements are\nusually built on Meta and on the Gupshup console, the journey setup, bot\njourney setup and the retargeting of messaging can be done. So let\\'s\nsay a person comes across an ad, they can click on an ad and get\nredirected onto WhatsApp. But using this particular capability, they can\nclick onto an ad and get redirected onto WhatsApp and they can talk to a\nbot that has been made on the journey builder of Bot Studio. They can\nalso send out retargeting messages that can be free for them up to 72\nhours if at all they go inactive during the conversation.\n\nHere\\'s what the journey builder looks like. There are different types\nof blocks to support, to make a journey. A journey always starts with a\nstarting node where in it can start on the basis of an event, can also\nbe on the basis of AI trigger where in the AI can understand the intent\nof a customer directly without saying hi or a hello and then start\nassisting them. It can also be on the basis of user input where in you\ncan simply enter the keyword: hey, hi, hello, whatever. After you setup\nthe starting node, there are three types of nodes that are used to\norchestrate the journey. Prompt nodes are used for asking questions to\ncustomers, message nodes are used to send out different types of\nmessages to the customers, whether in you can try to send a PDF file, an\nimage, an audio file, a button with reply a message with reply buttons,\na list menu.

After one minute, a small form will pop up in this chat, which\nlooks something like this and the user can start entering their\ninformation. So this is an example of a WhatsApp flow, it obviously has\nhigher conversion rates and it also has capabilities like multiple\nchoice answers that people can simply select instead of typing. They can\nhave their email validated as well, they can enter their phone number\nand there\\'s also an option for date picker as well, drop downs,\nmultiple choice answers and all of those functionalities are available\nin this form. And it looks a little engaging as well. So that is also a\ncapability that can be accessed using the Gupshup\\'s journey builder.\n\nWe also have AI Admin where in AI bots are orchestrated. A bot can be\ntrained on different types of content, which could be a website link, a\nPDF, TXT, CSV file or even text input. Once a website is or once the\ncontent is trained, you can start training the bot using prompts and\ndefine the engagement rules, how is the bot gonna communicate with\nusers, how is it gonna communicate in case it does not know something,\nhow is it gonna communicate in case somebody asks rubbish to the bot\nwhich is out of context or which is not related to the use case. All\nthose functionalities can be defined in the AI Admin workspace. And then\nthe AI Admin workspace can be called into the journey builder using the\nAI node.\n\nWe also have Analytics where in users can get a bird\\'s eye view of how\nmany conversations are happening, how many people are engaging, how many\nmessages are being sent by customers, how many messages are being sent\nby bots, what is the total number of messages and similar information in\na graphical manner.

Then you also have journey tracking where\nin you can see the journey name, how many total messages are in the\njourney, active conversations, average messages per conversation and all\nof that. Dropoff nodes, similar data that we saw in the conversational\npath is also available in the dropoff nodes. In the AI node, you can see\nthe total number of utterances, how many of these are unidentified\nutterances. That means how many of the prompts or how many user inputs\nwas the bot trained on, those are identified utterances and if at all\nthe bot wasn\\'t trained on them it could not identify the utterance,\nthat goes under unidentified utterances. Total FAQs, how many were\nanswered, how many were unanswered. We also have an API through which\nall the unanswered FAQs can be accessed and then the bot can be\nretrained for improved accuracy. Instead of commerce bots, product\nsearch and query utterances can also be accessed.\n\nWe also have Goal nodes which are used to basically capture the journey\nperformance and user inputs. So if at all the requirement is to capture\nwhat kind of users are clicking on what kinds of buttons in a in a reply\nbutton or what are they answering, you can simply store that data using\na goal node. If at all I click on analytics, this is how you can see how\nmany people have achieved a goal, how many of them were unique and you\ncan also export the data to see what milestones and trackers did they\nmove from. So you can see if at all there was a five node journey, you\ncan always track at which point of the journey which phone number is\ndropping off.

My name is Purushottam. People also know me as Puru, part\nof the pre-sales team. I, along with, lead the India-based pre-sales\nteam. Right. So, in this video I\\'m going to talk about WhatsApp Flows.\nI\\'m sure most of you will have certain ideas about what a WhatsApp flow\nis. But to start off with, I would want to want you to look at a\nparticular video which I mean, which is nothing but a WhatsApp flow, and\nthen after we\\'ll get into the platform in order to learn how do you\nbuild it, how do you deploy it, and how the platform works around it.\nRight? o, yeah. This is a campaign which Policybazaar was doing with us.\nBasically, Policybazaar, all of you will know, it\\'s an insurance\nbroker. So, this video is nothing but a video demonstration of how\nPolicybazaar used WhatsApp flows to go ahead and generate more more\nleads, get in the onboarding details from the end users altogether. So,\nthis this video which you see, the very first thing which starts off\nhere is the template. So, basically Policybazaar sent out a particular\ntemplate to the end user, saying that, \\\"Hey, you\\'re interested, would\nif you would be interested in buying so-and-so term life insurance\\\". If\nthe user clicks \\\"Proceed,\\\" this is the form which opens up. This form\nis nothing but WhatsApp Flows. It\\'s a feature wherein dynamic elements\nsuch as a date picker, a free text, a button, or a drop-down button,\nradio buttons, all of those things which you normally see on a mobile\napplication or a website form fill up, all of those things can happen\nwithin the WhatsApp universe, within the WhatsApp page. You look at it\nwherein it\\'s a web view opening up within the WhatsApp screen. That\\'s\nwhat a WhatsApp flow is, wherein if if we need to ask the user a lot of\nquestions which is not possible using a traditional step-by-step flow,\nthen WhatsApp flows comes in really handy, wherein you could ask those\nsame questions in a form format, wherein they could fill out the details\neasily, just to go ahead and have a better user experience altogether.\nYeah. So, that\\'s now that we have defined a WhatsApp flow, what it is,\nand I\\'ve shown you how does it function exactly, let me quickly go\nahead and show you how do you build it on our platform. So, the very\nfirst thing which you do is you come here to Bot Studio. There is a\nseparate section for WhatsApp flows. As soon as you come here, all of\nthe line items which you see are nothing but individual WhatsApp flows.\nLet me take an example of this one here, which is DBS. This is a lead\ngeneration journey which we built for them in order for them to go ahead\nand qualify and onboard customers who want to open savings bank account\nover there. Okay. So, it\\'s pretty simple as you see. There is this\nstarting node which","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Flows.md"}},{"id":"kb/Flows.md::chunk::4","text":"is a\nseparate section for WhatsApp flows.

So, it\\'s pretty simple as you see. There is this\nstarting node which asks for a flow ID, and there is this terminal node\nwhich defines what happens after the WhatsApp flow is completed. Now,\nthis flow ID is nothing but this encapsulates the entire WhatsApp form\nthat we have created. Right? So, to create a form up till now, it is not\navailable out of the box on the console platform. We\\'ll have to go to\nthe solutions mode platform, or even we could build it using the Meta\nDeveloper Platform over there. So, quickly let me take you to the\nplayground here. Over here, this is the Meta Developer Platform wherein\nyou could build your WhatsApp flows. So, as you could see, there is this\none screen. You could I mean, as you could see, there is this one screen\nwhich covers all of these details, asking the user. You can edit it. I\nmean, maybe if you want to change the details here, that\\'s fine. You\ncan enter whatever you want, and that would reflect in your render in\nreal time over here for you to go ahead and define different WhatsApp\nflows. So, the options which it gives are in four different categories.\nOne is text that you could render. The second is media, of course,\nimages. Text answers, as in if you need answers to particular questions.\nAnd then after, there is selections, as in you can have single choice,\nmultiple choice questions which you could ask, or even give the user a\ndrop-down menu or an opt-in approach as in a toggle button over there.\nOkay. These are the elements. Once you have created everything, you get\nthis \\\"Copy Flow JSON\\\". Let me quickly open up a new notepad for this\nand show you. So, once you have created the UI, you have to get this\nJSON file. Okay, JSON file, which is nothing but which actually maps out\nthe entire journey that you have built, and you have to take it to\nWhatsApp Flow Builder.

So, then\nafter you select whether you want it static or dynamic. Let me define\nwhat is a static flow. A static flow is a predefined form that you give\nout to the end users, no matter what. But a dynamic flow is basis each\nselection in that particular form or WhatsApp flow, when you move on to\nthe next page of that particular flow, then it changes according to the\nbehavior or according to the inputs which have come in. Just keep it\nsimple and give you a fair idea. I\\'m going to keep it static. You can\ngo ahead and select these things here. I\\'ll select \\\"Self-Serve\nIndia\\\". Account type. And then you go on to submit that. Post that you\nget the option to go ahead and paste your JSON file which you have\ncopied from here in the playground. You can obviously build it right\nhere as well in in this section if you want to. But I\\'ve I\\'ve created\nthis flow. It has this flow ID, if you could see. And I\\'ll go ahead and\nedit this and put in my JSON file right here. Sorry, I I think I didn\\'t\ncopy that properly. Copy it. Put it here. Put the JSON file here. You\nhave the flow builder right here as well. You can go ahead and add\nscreens just like the playground over there, screen name, everything.\nBut I find the Meta platform pretty easy and more UI friendly in order\nto build this. Hence, I copy the JSON from there and put it here. You\ncan save it as drafted and then get to preview the journey if you have\nto. And yeah, you can go ahead and check the preview. It\\'ll load out\nload up something like this. The same thing which we have built over\nthere. There are different pages if you could see, just like what I have\nbuilt over there. Over here, if you could see, then there are two\ndifferent pages that we have built. One is the feedback one, one by two\nand two by two. Same thing rendered over there if you see. So,\nsimilarly, I mean, you build your journey right here on the Meta\nDeveloper Platform, copy the JSON, put it here, check that for preview.\nIt is necessary that you check that for preview because there at times\nit does fail. And then you publish. Once you have published, as I was\nsaying, you get this flow ID. This ID you have to copy it from here.\nMove it. Move back to Console, go to WhatsApp Flows, and create a new\nflow and put that ID over there. Once you have done so, I\\'ll go back to\nthe same example.

After\nfilling out the starting node, you also have to use this terminal node\nand define a journey over here. What is that? We\\'ll look at in detail.\nBut before that, let\\'s go back to the journey builder and show you how\nto connect this WhatsApp flow which we have built into a real journey.\nSo, DBS. I\\'ll just go to the same. Yeah, DBS Lead Generation Journey.\nSo, it\\'s pretty much like a simple journey that we create on Journey\nBuilder. Starts with a starting node which defines the input which will\ntrigger this journey, that is \\\"DBS Guru\\\". This is the keyword I\\'ve\nkept to trigger this particular journey. And then we I have this welcome\nimage. If you want it, keep it there. If you don\\'t want it, just get it\nover with. No problems. Then there is this message which I have defined.\nSee, until here it is just a normal journey, normal two-way\nconversational journey which we use the Journey Builder to build it. But\npost that, you use this block which is this one here: WhatsApp flow. You\ndrag and drop that, connect it to whichever journey you want to. And\nthen after you go ahead and select from the drop-down of all of the\nWhatsApp flows which is available. This drop-down gets populated by the\nlist of options which you have given here, WhatsApp flows, the one which\nwe defined just right now, right? With the flow ID we defined a WhatsApp\nflow. So, you need to go ahead and select one of those and whatever\njourney you have created, and you\\'re good to go. That\\'s that\\'s all\nyou have to do to go ahead and connect a WhatsApp flow to a particular\njourney in the Journey Builder. And once you have done that, of course,\nnow I\\'m going to go ahead and talk about the terminal journey, as in\nwhat I showed you there. So, let me just type \\\"DBS\\\" again. \\\"DBS\nTerminal Journey.\\\" What happens here? This is nothing but after the\nWhatsApp form, which was here. Let me show you this. Yeah. Let me go\nback a little bit. So, this is a form which is getting continued, right?\nIt started here. If I go back a little bit, so let\\'s imagine that,\nokay, let\\'s imagine that this piece until this piece, this message\nwhich has come up, \\\"Hey, welcome to Policybazaar\\\", this is part of our\njourney, which is nothing but this one, DBS Lead Gen.

This\nmessage which comes up post that, once this node is triggered, WhatsApp\nflow, the WhatsApp flow journey triggers over here, if you see. Yeah.\nThis form popping up, this is built inside this node here. And once this\nform is filled up to whatever pages it has, doesn\\'t matter. Once that\nis done and the form closes, then comes the terminal journey in action.\nOkay. Yeah. So, now the form has closed and it has come back to a real\njourney. I mean, as in, that is also real as in, what I\\'m trying to say\nis a step-by-step journey. Here if you see, coming back, yeah. It has a\nlink and it is taking the user to an external website. But point is, as\nsoon as the WhatsApp flow, this one, this form closes up, this message\nis part of the external journey, as in terminal journey. And that\\'s\nwhat we have defined in here, if you go if you see this, uh DBS Terminal\nJourney. Yeah. So, that is after the form closes, I\\'m asking for OTP.\nI\\'m showing the images over there and the journey follows up. But now\nwe need to go ahead and connect this terminal journey to WhatsApp flow.\nSo, in the WhatsApp flow journey builder again, if I show you this, if\nyou see this clearly, you\\'ve got terminal journey here. Right? That\\'s\nit. That\\'s how you build a WhatsApp flow, build, link it to a journey,\nand then after deploy it on a production environment.

So those steps are referred to as milestones. So in my\nmilestone one I just renamed it as preferences because in these in this\nmilestone I\\'ll be having two trackers I\\'ll be collecting a person\\'s\ncity and their date.\n\nIn default value I have input 0 as a default and then I have clicked on\nsave. So now I can go back and in now I can come out to my board studios\njourney builder. Click on create a journey but I already have one\njourney simple journey created wherein I have set this as the trigger\nword and I am just asking myself two questions.\n\nWhat is my city and what\\'s my date. And after this I have a goal node\nso I delete this particular goal node and in my last node I\\'ll say\nI\\'ll select the goal that I just created which is goal demonstration.\nIn this I\\'ll select the milestone which is preferences.\n\nNow all these responses I\\'m storing momentarily in a variable demo var\nand again this again a similar momentary variable whose name is demo\nunderscore var. So once I have this goal node which of course I can\nclick by navigating over here. Just a second toggle this off and then\nthis.\n\nNow in my action nodes we have a goal node from this. So there\\'s one\nalready over here. So I\\'ll select the goal I\\'ll select the milestone\nname and in the tracker values.\n\nSo city I was storing in a variable called demo underscore var. So in\ncity I\\'ll recall this particular variable. So whenever a user enters\ntheir input value then that can be called in such a manner.\n\nAnd then the second which is the city the date I\\'m storing it in var\ndemo. I\\'ll do this. I\\'ll store it in this particular variable for now\ndate then I can come over here and recall this variable in such a\nmanner.\n\nNow our journey has been made and then let\\'s customize this message a\nlittle. So I\\'ll now click on save and deploy. Now this journey has been\ndeployed.\n\nWe\\'ll wait for hardly 10 to 15 seconds. Now I can come out to WhatsApp\nand maybe try and trigger this particular journey. So maybe I\\'ll say\ngoal demo.\n\nI get asked the question I\\'ll say Delhi.

Today we\\'ll discuss on how brands can leverage Instagram\nin their omni channel strategies. So once you are logged on on the on\nthe platform, you have to navigate to Channels. Under Channels there is\na module called Instagram. You have to select it and once the\nconnection, when I say connection it\\'s basically linking Gupshup\nplatform with your Instagram accounts, been done, you\\'ll be able to see\ntwo tabs here: Instagram settings and App settings. Under App App\nsettings you will see all the configuration which have app name, app\nkey, and app ID. And then you will see a button to unlink this account.\nI\\'ll come back to the Instagram settings because this is where the\nmagic happens and brands can start leveraging WhatsApp to engage users.\nAnd there are multiple ways to engage users on Instagram through Gupshup\nplatform. On the screen you can see two types here: Icebreakers and\nPersistent Menu. So, Icebreakers are basically it\\'s to help new user to\nstart a conversation with the brand. Okay. So, there will be a list of\nfrequently asked questions that you can configure here and it is like\nyou can have maximum of four question that can be set as a Icebreaker.\nSo, here on the screen you can see right there are four Icebreakers,\nthree Icebreakers created here and you can add a new one where you can\nlike give a name here \\\"learn more\\\" and then enter a payload. Correct.\nAnd then if you want to add a reason specific Icebreakers then you can\nlike select for which specific reason or language you want to create a\nlocale and you can configure it here as well. So, this is how you\nconfigure Icebreakers. I\\'ll come back and I\\'ll show you how to set up\nPersistent Menu. Again, Persistent Menu is basically a menu of business\nmain features. Okay. So, if if uh if you will basically log to the\nInstagram page of a business, you will see a hamburger icon here and\nonce you click on there you will see like a persistent menu. So, for\nexample, you can see there is a persistent menu already created,\n\\\"Interested\\\". So, again if you want to create another such menu\nyou\\'ll get an option to either configure a reply button or a URL. Okay.\nSo, reply button is basically to send a predefined text message on\nbehalf of the user. URL is basically to redirect user to external\nwebsite. So, if you want to like have a URL set up here, so you can say\n\\\"Visit us\\\" and give a URL here which can be something like this. You\ncan click on save. You can see the success right. So, this is how like\nthere are two this is like two ways to start engaging with a user on\nInstagram and then there is another way where you can basically\nconfigure a autoresponder. Okay. So, autoresponders are","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Instagram.md"}},{"id":"kb/Instagram.md::chunk::3","text":"URL is basically to redirect user to external\nwebsite. So, if you want to like have a URL set up here, so you can say\n\\\"Visit us\\\" and give a URL here which can be something like this. You\ncan click on save. You can see the success right. So, this is how like\nthere are two this is like two ways to start engaging with a user on\nInstagram and then there is another way where you can basically\nconfigure a autoresponder. Okay. So, autoresponders are basically single\nmessage replies that a business can send to a user. If they for example\ncomment on business post or reply or react to the business stories or\nmaybe they mentioned the business Instagram handle in their own story so\nand so forth right. So, if you come under Bot Studio and go under\njourneys you\\'ll see like I\\'m going to show you. For example, you just\nhave to create a journey and this is a sample journey that I created for\nthis demo. Where the starting node can be an event, right? Which can be\na user event. And then I just write a simple code here where I\\'m just\ntaking the message object type. So, this message object type can be\nanything like a reply or a comment so and so forth. Right? So, I\\'m just\nstoring that in a variable called \\\"autoresponder\\\". Now I have written\na small condition here like if that\\'s equal to a reply or if it is\nequal to reels comment or equals to reply to a story so and so forth I\nwill have a different or a differentiated experience for those users.\nSo, based on what is the user input they will see different responses.\nSo, this is how you can basically configure autoresponder on Instacart\nright. So, yeah so like these are like strategies that business can\nstart implementing through our platform and start engaging with the\nusers on Instagram. So, that\\'s it for this session. Thanks for joining.\nIf you need any other help you can refer to console docs dot gupshop dot\ncom gupshop dot io where we have documented the entire platform and\nit\\'s a user guide for the platform.

In today\\'s session, we are going\nto cover integrations. So, we\\'ll going to cover the console\nintegrations. So before we talk about console integration, we majorly\nhave three kind of integrations. One is the native integration which you\ncan currently look at on the screen which we have with MoEngage,\nCleverTap and Shopify. I\\'ll talk about it in depth. Then we also have\nconnectors available with leading CRMs, ERPs, and Martech platform. To\nknow more about them, you can go to this page particularly\ngupshup.io/integrations/connectors. You can just search about any of the\nconnectors like which you are looking at and you\\'ll be able to know\nthat which kind of connectors we have with these systems available. Okay\ncoming back, when it comes to integrations with MoEngage, CleverTap and\nShopify, which are Martech and e-com platform, how this works is that,\nfor example with MoEngage, we enable customers to easily and seamlessly\nlaunch campaigns directly from the MoEngage account. The steps in\nconfigurations are super simple, it just happens with a click. We have a\ndetailed document available here which talks about MoEngage integration\nin depth. Similarly when it comes to Shopify, we have, you know, we\nenable businesses to send important events or attributes to Gupshup\nwhich subsequently can be used for sending out personalized campaigns.\nSo majorly if you want to understand the events which we cover in\nShopify integration, these are order fulfillment, order placement,\ncancellation, abandoned cart or checkout reminders. And then this\nintegration can also be achieved by just the configuration and the\nentire details about MoEngage, Shopify and CleverTap is available in\nthis thread. So if you want to know more about that, you can look at\nCleverTap integration, MoEngage or Shopify from this thread itself.\nOkay, coming back, after that we do have also one thing called custom\nintegration. Now how custom integration works is that and what is the,\nyou know, understanding of custom integration? So now apart from\nMoEngage, CleverTap or Shopify, if a business wants to send or pass\nevent from any of the external systems which can be their CRMs, it can\nbe their website, we can actually pitch them or we can give them a\ncustom integration solution. Now once we receive those events, we can\nactually leverage these event in different modules in our console\nplatform which we will shortly look at. Now how this entire structure\nworks obviously you also have a detailed document available on how\ncustom integration works. I\\'ll quickly talk about it, so let\\'s look at\nby creating clicking on creating a custom integration, once you click on\nthat, you just have to name your custom integration. So we\\'ll just keep\na name like t","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Integrations.md"}},{"id":"kb/Integrations.md::chunk::5","text":"events, we can\nactually leverage these event in different modules in our console\nplatform which we will shortly look at.

I\\'ll quickly talk about it, so let\\'s look at\nby creating clicking on creating a custom integration, once you click on\nthat, you just have to name your custom integration. So we\\'ll just keep\na name like test_academy for now and then you just have to define the\nJSON path here as well which also acts like a unique event identifier.\nNow once you come here at this particular page, you will see the two\ndifferent details here. One is the callback URL which will be generated\nand the authorization token. So callback URL obviously is a webhook\nthrough which the event data can be passed on and the authorization\ntoken is for URL authentication. Obviously if you want to also or\ndevelopers also want to look at the payload structure, the sample JSON\ncan be seen over here. And if you see here this is the place wherein we\ncan actually add the events. So once you\\'ll click on an add event, by\ndefault these two events will come up. For example let\\'s suppose we are\nlooking at creating a lead generation event. Right, so or a signup\nevent. So let\\'s suppose if somebody signs up on a website or in mobile\napp, we want to pass that event to our platform. So we can put in any of\nthe unique identifier. Apart from having the default, you know, property\ntype which is data type which can be text or timestamp, we can actually\nadd property. For this we can actually name a property called, you know,\ntest and we can actually also select if this property type can be a\nnumber, text, decimal or whatever. So we can just select it like this\nand we can just create an additional property. Here we are creating a\nsignup event and we can actually save this event here after creating it.\nSo yeah, so once we do that, how do we leverage these events is that\nobviously once you create the event and do the configuration, you can\nuse this event either in the Bot Studio. In the Bot Studio, you can just\nsimply use this event to trigger automated message once the signup event\nhas happened. So imagine once a customer signed up on a website,\nautomated message can be triggered to customer on WhatsApp. And\nsimilarly you can also leverage this in our personalize layer or\npersonalize module wherein in case if you want to pass this customer\nevent and update any property about that user or customer, it can also\nflow in through the event section here. So if you see here in the event,\nwhatever new events you are creating will get listed here and that can\nsubsequently be mapped across the profiles in the personalized layer.\nYeah.

There are different uh other views as well but I\\'m going to\ntalk about dashboard first and move on this to this direction. So the on\nthe dashboard you\\'ll be able to see the live matrices such as uh active\nusers or the total number of messages in last 120 minutes which is\nnothing but the last two hours of them. Then you get to see the message\ninsights as in the total number of messages, the customer messages and\nthe bot messages. Okay, you are you are free to go ahead and select the\ndate range or the channel you want to see it for. So it could be with\nWhatsApp or web or Instagram for that sake. You can select all of those\nthings just at one go. Now you might also be wondering what is this\n40% - 41%? Well, this is nothing but uh the comparison of uh the total\nfor example let\\'s take this the total number of messages in this date\nrange that is 19 to 26 which is this particular weeks or last 7 days\ndata has been 130 messages but if we compare to the previous 7 days\nwhich is from I mean which is from the 19th to the last seven days which\ncould be 1 2 3 4 5 6. So 13 to 19th this data compared with 19th to 16th\nthat\\'s what is being shown here. So I mean compared to the previous\nweek\\'s data that this has gone down by 40%. Similar similarly are the\ncustomer messages and similar are the bot messages over there. Okay. So\nit gives the end user who is looking at this analytics dashboard what is\nthe traction the bot is bringing and how is it performing compared to\nthe previous week. So maybe the the bot designer or the campaign manager\nhas made certain changes to the bot orchestration or maybe there have\nbeen campaigns on CPASS increased volume or reduced volume basis those\nvariables how does the interaction change in the bot that\\'s something\nwhich has been demonstrated here and then all of that data into tabular\nformat or let\\'s say not the tabular format in a graphical format here\nthe number of messages versus the days over there. Then comes the\nconversational insights total number of conversations and the average\nmessage per per conversation","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/JB Analytics.md"}},{"id":"kb/JB Analytics.md::chunk::4","text":"been campaigns on CPASS increased volume or reduced volume basis those\nvariables how does the interaction change in the bot that\\'s something\nwhich has been demonstrated here and then all of that data into tabular\nformat or let\\'s say not the tabular format in a graphical format here\nthe number of messages versus the days over there. Then comes the\nconversational insights total number of conversations and the average\nmessage per per conversation. Now previous one was individual messages.\nHere we are talking about let\\'s say sessions like I come to the bot I\ntalk about four five things I ask different queries that\\'s a\nconversation. Okay so there are five conversations so far and the\naverage messages per conversation is 26. Now over here there\\'s a uh\nthere\\'s this matrix going down whereas this one is increasing. What\ndoes it mean exactly? Well total conversations have gone down by 58%.\nWell this means that compared to the previous date range this is lower.\nThis should have been higher whereas average messages have gone high.\nRight? So customers are using the journey well the even when the\nconversations have gone down but the average messages per conversation\nhas has increased drastically by 44%. As in people are more interested\nin talking about a particular uh particular thing in a given\nconversation. So less number of people but the people are more\ninterested. That\\'s that\\'s what you can make out of this matrix here.\nSame thing in a graphical format here. This thing which I want to cover\nis organic as in how many people are organically coming into the\nplatform and conversing with us. That\\'s what it shows. And the third\nmatrix which you get on the dashboard is user insights. You get to see\nhow many are active users, how many are new users, how many are return\nusers over there and the average messages per user. So if you see on\nthis test uh account the active users have gone down. The new users have\ngone down compared to the previous uh previous week. return users at are\nat the same level 0%. But the average messages per user has increased by\n29%. Which is which means that I mean although the active users or the\nreturn users are less but the users who have come back within the six\nand five 11 users they are conversing more with the bot. So maybe we we\nhave done something positive on the bot which is helping them to go\nahead and engage even better within with the customer with the bot over\nthere. Similarly, user trends into different graphical format. Let\\'s\ncome to the conversational path. Again, you have the option of selecting\nthe date trains, the channels you want to see the you can uh drill down\nto individual journey statistics if you want to see that.

I mean, you\nhave built 10 different journeys. How is one journey performing? You can\ngo ahead and select that particular journey here. And that the data of\nthat particular journey would obviously apply here. Even you can define\nthe source whether you want it to be marketing look at the marketing\nstatistics basically you have sent out message on WhatsApp and RCAs and\nother given channels what is the kind of uh traction coming in from\nthere. CTX as in C2WA what is the kind of uh traffic ads Facebook\nInstagram ads are bringing into the platform organic is simply user\ninitiated as in the user by themselves have come to the WhatsApp number\nor the Instagram bot maybe there is a widget on the website of the\ncustomer or somewhere which is redirecting the user but then again it\\'s\nmore it is organic there\\'s no money spent on it. Okay so uh let\\'s\nimagine I mean as the number shows there are 26 people who come to the\nstart node as in come to the waba number or the Instagram bot over there\nor any given channel. They start a conversation that is the total\nnumber. How many people went into which direction which journey what\npercentage as you can see over here uh there are there 3.8% of the users\nwho visited journey 696 and they 100% of that that is one customer\nvisited the journey and then continue to the next step of the journey\nover there. Similarly, if if I want to see other journeys over there. So\nthis view as in this conversational path shows you nothing but the exact\ndrop offs which first of all exact bifurcation of users. how many users\nare actually uh talking to you in which particular journey and what is\nthe traffic going further in the next steps. If customers are dropping\noff a particular step that means that step has a problem and we need to\nfix it. Similarly, there are there\\'s a separate dashboard for uh exit\nnodes. Let me change this view maybe just a second. Okay, let me change\nthis. We have changed the project just so that I have some data here.\nThere\\'s some problem with this. I\\'m not sure what\\'s happening here.\nBut uh the whole idea of exit nodes is to let users know uh which\nparticular journey which particular node as in the step of the journey\nare the customers dropping off the max.

And\nthen comes the most interesting piece which is the AI uh dashboard. It\nof course you have different filters over there. I\\'m not going to go to\nthat again but uh it gives you the total number of utterances as in\nutter addressances are nothing but the user inputs in three text. uh\nthen how many were unidentified and how many were identified. Ideally,\nthis should be reverse as in 34 should be identified and seven should be\nunidentified. But this is just a test account. Basically, letting the\nadministrator know okay your bot bots\\'s efficiency is this much. If 100\nqueries come in, out of that 70 or 85% of them go answered and rest\ndon\\'t go answered and that could that needs rectification. Similarly, I\nmean there is a multiple workspace uh concept as you would know to go\nahead and segregate the data and keep it handy for the end agent. So the\njourney name, the intent trigger, the number of time it\\'s been\ntriggered, the top journeys or the intents which are performing the best\nget listed out here. So that that the admin or the bot designer can\ndrive insights from it and make the other journeys also better. Okay.\nSimilarly, I mean there is FAQs. Well, every business needs to go ahead\nand answer the queries of the customer and also go ahead and engage with\nthem in a two-way conversational journey to go ahead and enable services\nfor them. For example, if I am an ecom brand, I need to answer questions\nsuch as uh what\\'s my uh what\\'s my return policy? That\\'s one. But I\nalso be need to be able to go ahead and uh let the users order from a\nbot platform altogether.

So under Bot Studio, you'll find multiple subsections,\nJourneys is the place where you need to focus on. All right, so journeys\ncan now be of three types, User initiated as in the user comes to our\nchannel or chatbot or our agent and types in hi or hey or whatever,\ndoesn\\'t matter, but user comes to the conversation and that\\'s user\njourneys. Then there is Campaign Journeys, basically the brand initiates\nthe conversation, the brand sends out that particular message on\nWhatsApp, on RCS or any given channel where in push notification and\ntwo-way conversations are possible. So the brand sends that message and\nthen we link it then if the customer replies back. For example if let\\'s\nsay we send out a communication, a promotional message from a bank to a\ncustomer that you\\'re eligible for this particular card and there\\'s\nthis reply button on top of it which says apply now. So as soon as the\nuser clicks on apply now, a campaign journey gets initiated, right? And\nthen there there are Ad Journeys, basically I\\'m sure you have you have\nheard of C2WA click to WhatsApp. So now customers coming in from\nFacebook, Instagram, TikTok or even Google, Google ads can be redirected\nto WhatsApp and as soon as they\\'re on WhatsApp, there\\'s this ice\nbreaker which gets configured, which gets auto populated on the text box\nof the customer\\'s phone and as soon as the user sends that particular\nmessage, a journey gets triggered. So now specific ads can be mapped to\nspecific journeys and those are ad journeys. Now you must be thinking\nwhy these three categories? Pretty simple. For example let\\'s say Apply\nNow, this is the keyword that we map to user journeys and whenever a\nuser says Apply Now, a journey starts starts off, but there could be a\ncampaign campaign message as well which has been sent out to the\ncustomer which says apply now. Or maybe a brand has sent three different\npromotional messages one for credit card, one for an FD offer and and\none for a debit card offer. All of them contain the same title which is\napply now. So if we do not have this segregation if we do not have these\nthese mappings here, then the bot or the agent would get confused right?\nI mean which apply now which journey to be triggered? Hence the\nbifurcation hence we have kept three different categories of journeys\nhere making it making it more simpler and easier for the bot designer to\ngo ahead and have a pinpointed conversation with the end user. So now\nwhat you see on your screen I\\'ll just refer to user journeys mostly\njourney creation for every given every given subcategory over here is\nthe same.

There\\'s no difference between journey creation or there are\nno extra let\\'s say nodes or steps or types of messages which are\navailable in one kind of journey and not the other. Everything remains\nsimilar, right? So okay, so all of these line items which you see,\nplease ignore the names of them, these are individual journeys, right?\nSo I\\'m going to stick to the same example here. For example, we are\ncreating a banking bot let\\'s say a WhatsApp banking bot for example,\nthen","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Journey Builder.md"}},{"id":"kb/Journey Builder.md::chunk::3","text":"## Modular Architecture Principles\nthe journey builder is designed in such a way that we could we\nshould keep each journey separate. What I'm trying to say is let's say\nthere is a balance inquiry journey, that is a separate line item here\nand then there is fund transfer which is a separate line item line item,\nthen there could be open FD and so on and so on, right? So we'll have I\nmean the journey builder is designed to go ahead and give a modular\nnature to the end to the backend of a particular bot that we create.\nWhy? Because it\\'s obvious that it will get easier to maintain these\njourneys without so it\\'s it\\'s very similar to microservices in the\nsoftware development and monolithic architecture. If it is monolithic\nevery small change might take more time because it it might affect other\nfunctionality but if we keep things modular, of course it gets easier to\nmaintain and implement, right? So I\\'ll go back a step. Yeah, so you\\'ve\ngot three things here I\\'ve I\\'ve obviously got developer mode access\nover here hence I\\'m able to see database, but for a general user also\nthere is this test bot so as soon as you create a particular journey,\nyou\\'ll be able to test it right here on this particular bot. So let\\'s\ncreate a journey. Once a user or a bot designer clicks on this\nparticular button, they get all of these options here, I mean these\noptions are nothing but predefined templates which the user or the bot\ndesigner could readily pick up and start the development, right?\nObviously I mean the user would not have to start from scratch rather\nthe user could select from each of these journeys here. So let\\'s say I\nwant to do a lead generation journey. Right, so I\\'ll just zoom out. Now\nwhat you can see is is a flowchart here, right? Different blocks\nconnected together with the arrow mark on it and it goes towards from\nthe start to the end over there, right?

So basically every particular journey will have\na start node. This start node is nothing but this tells the bot to\ntrigger which particular journey at which given time, right? So for\nexample there could be a user input, right? If someone enters balance\ninquiry or something like that, or let\\'s say apply now, some keyword\nyou can keep adding these keywords you can have different operators in\nhere which could help trigger this particular journey. So the primary\nidea is that starting node gives you the agility to go ahead and map\nwhatever input or event do you want the journey to be triggered at?\nOkay, so it could be user input, it could be AI trigger, maybe we train\nan intent we\\'ll obviously look at other modules of bot studio wherein\nAI admin is a piece wherein you could train intent and then after\ninstead of sticking to just two or three keywords to trigger a\nparticular journey, the bot could actually be a little more intuitive\nand understand the user intent. For example if someone comes to the\nbanking bot same banking bot and says what\\'s my balance, it will be\nable to understand it and trigger this particular journey or I want to\napply for a credit card then that intent will get triggered and the\nparticular journey would be rendered in front of the customer on\nwhatever channel it is, right? Be it WhatsApp or others. Okay, so\nthat\\'s starting node but then after defining what triggers this journey\nyou\\'ll have to define the steps of the journey there right? So the very\nfirst one is over here in this template it is welcome to the support\njourney, please help me with the following details. The very first one\nis we are asking for name, then we are asking for phone number and you\ncan see the connections between the journeys over there. Now we I mean\nwe continue to ask all of those questions basically whatever questions\nwe want the bot to ask to the end user while in while in runtime while\nthe user is availing this service on a particular chatbot, this is how\nit is done, right? Now let me show you what are other options are\navailable for a bot designer to go ahead and use while they\\'re crafting\nthat journey out. It could be a simple text message simple as that. It\ncould be an image or an audio file which could be rendered in front of\nthe customer similarly it could be a reply button you must have seen a\nlot of examples of these this is basically nothing but a card like\ntemplate wherein there is a header it could be a image video or\nsomething then there is a body and there are buttons, right?

You send out a message\nwhich has a header as a as a media file and then there is the body which\nexplains the offer or whatever it is and then there are CTA buttons at\nthe bottom. Similar to that in the bot journeys you could have such\nstuff and then there could be a list, a quick reply all of that of\ncourse you can go ahead and filter it out basis the channel that you\\'re\ndefining the journey for. It could be send location you can ask for a\nlocation of a particular customer, it could be WhatsApp flows we\\'ll\ntalk about WhatsApp flows in a bit. I\\'ll I\\'ll be making another video\nfor it in which I\\'ll try and make you understand how a WhatsApp flow\njourney is built on console, right? So that\\'s that\\'s the message\nsection and then we have actions, basically these are the actions the\nbot will perform if the user goes through a specific branch of a\nparticular journey, right? So we can define conditions basis which the\nlogic could change, we can connect different journeys with the help of\ncall and return as I was saying earlier, right? That we\\'ll have to I\nmean keep it modular, balance inquiry is one journey, fund transfer is\nanother. So basically I mean as a whole it it is irrelevant to the end\nuser that whether you keep it monolithic or if you have modular nature\nin your backend but eventually we\\'ll have to go ahead and give the user\na seamless experience by connecting these journeys together, right? And\nthat\\'s that\\'s when call and return comes into the picture at whatever\nstep in a particular journey you want to trigger another journey or\nconnect that journey you could bring it use this particular node.\nSimilarly there is agent transfer which is nothing but as soon as the\njourney reaches this particular step an automatic chat will be created\nin the agent assistant panel and the human touch could be brought in,\nright?

For example my balance could be something else, your balance\ncould be something else and that would require certain API integrations\nas in this data resides on the bank server and Gupshup has no clue of\nit. So in order to go ahead and fetch that piece of information and put\nit in front of the customer we'll need an API call and that API call\ncould be defined wherever wherever in the journey we want to trigger it,\nso basically to pull and push information from this journey into the\nclient's backend is something which can be done using API block. The\nAPI block is basically an emulation of nothing but the popular software\ncalled Postman, basically the software is used to go ahead and test\ndifferent kinds of APIs especially the REST APIs over there with so\nbasically you can either import the entire Postman collection over here\nand then configure it wherever you want or you can build it ground up\nfrom here or you can even import the curl and put it right here. So all\nof the options mostly whatever whatever options are available to a\ndeveloper in a IDE or in in Postman similar to that we've kept it here,\nright? Now that's that's API block but then again there could be\ncertain business logics which cannot be defined using conditions and\ncall and return it might take it might be a very tedious to do so with\nthat function so in that case we'll bring in the code block basically\nthere is a whole ID in place kind of like a JavaScript editor wherein\nyou can write your JavaScript code and these code blocks can be can have\nsmall snippets of code and can be connected at the relevant step in the\njourney so that while in runtime if the user chose to click on that\nbutton the code gets executed otherwise it doesn't and the relevant\noutputs are given to the end customer. Now after that there are prompts\nnow there are certain questions which are pretty generic and are being\nused in most of the journeys over there, right? So for example let's\nlet's take an example of phone, right? We might need the phone number\nof the customer and this is needed to identify the customer in many of\nthe use cases and the journeys over there. So for those kind of stuff\nwherein it's I mean we can use ready to use blocks basically phone\nnumber, email, date, number, location request, address, all of that and\nthese come up with predefined validations also, right? For example a\nnumber could this is a regex nothing but a regular expression which has\nbeen defined, so in case the input of the user satisfies this expression\nonly then the bot will allow the user to go to the next step.

This this\nI mean I'll just try to explain this very simply this is nothing but a\na the validation which counts how I mean how many digits are there in a\nparticular number. So let's say the user entered a nine digit number,\nit will not accept it it will need 10 digits so that's that's what is\nbeing defined here. Other than that how many retries can can be given to\nthe user that is can be also be defined, you can define the failure\nmessage as well let's say the user entered a wrong number so at that\nparticular time you can say my apologies apologies the number is wrong\nplease enter the correct number or something like that. So the the\ndefinition of prompts is basically these are messages only but with a\npredefined purpose with a predefined thing which are generally used in\nmany of the journeys there just to make the bot designer's life easy\nit's prebuilt you just drag and drop it and it starts to work. Then\nthere are blocks now prompts are predefined preconfigure messages\nnothing but messages which can be used one at a time, right? But let's\nimagine that we are building building two three journeys in place and\nthere could be multiple API calls which are common for these journeys.\nFor example I mean I'm taking a very technical example here but let's\nsay let's say we're building the same banking bot, right? And to fetch\nto call the API of the customer the banking as in the balance inquiry\nAPI of the customer before that we'll have to call the authentication\nAPI to generate a token and that token needs to be fed to every given\nAPI be it the balance inquiry API be it the be it the fund transfer or\nopening an FD all of those APIs will require that authentication token.\nNow if we go ahead and try configure this particular API in every given\njourney it might be time consuming. So whatever journeys whatever steps\nthat are common for that are common for which are common for multiple\njourneys the bot bot designer can simply go ahead and create a block out\nof it, okay? Basically create a block out of it and then use that block\nacross different journeys whatever he or she is creating over there,\nright? So you can name this block and then this will be saved in the\njourney builder and whenever there is a need that could be used. So let\nme just maybe show you this the pre-existing blocks are like this\nprescription block or maybe the AI block let me pull this up from here\nand it says it has number three nodes I expand it, right?

I expand it\nthese are the num let's say I want to use these things here, right? So\nwhat I'll do is I'll simply drag and drop the block here and then\nI'll connect it to my existing journey somewhere like this maybe I'll\npick this one here and put it right here and it gets connected, right?\nAnd then I mean basically reuse of just like how we have reusability of\ncode here here we have reusability of journeys as well. So that's\npretty much it just one more thing I would like to cover so while we are\nbuilding a journey let's say we are building this particular journey\nright lead generation journey we ask for name, phone number, email,\nother things, right? So before we push it to their backend for example\nmaybe we have an API here which pushes all of this collected information\nfrom the bot to their CRM, right? Now in order to push this data we'll\nneed to temporarily at least store it somewhere the name of the\ncustomer, the phone number and other details that we have collected\nwe'll have to store it somewhere in the journey before pushing it to\nthe API and once we have push it to the CRM or the relevant system we\ndelete it from here. So what I mean to say is while in the runtime of\nthe journey while the user is executing the journey till we reach the\nlast step wherein we are pushing the data to their systems we'll need\nto temporarily store it somewhere and that's that's when variables\ncome into the picture, we go ahead and store pieces of information from\nthe journey from external systems from pre-existing knowledge all of\nthose over here and use it in the journeys wherever you want.

For example user channel ID\nthis thing this is nothing but if the user is on WhatsApp let's say for\nexample then as soon as the user says Hi and the bot starts to respond\nback and the journey builder takes the control in every given journey\nthis user channel ID will have the phone number of the customer. Now if\nat all I step we'll have to ask the user for their phone number\nrather asking we can pick it from here it will automate the journey it\nwill it will reduce one more touchpoint for the end user and it will\nmake their lives easier.

If you want to reach your users at the right time with the\nright message, this feature is essential. In this five-minute overview,\nthe speaker walks through how to leverage user engagement data and send\ntargeted campaigns based on optimal time windows. Whether you are\nmanaging high-volume customers or want to improve your response rate,\nthe Optimizer has you covered. One of the most important or powerful\nfeatures is the \"most engaging hours\" visualization, which also has some\nwindow analytics. You can see the total number of users active in the\nlast hour, as well as average activation in that hour and the \"most\nengaging hour\" data. There is a distributed component with respect to\nthe most engaging hour data where you are able to see at what time the\nnumber of users is high and when you can actually target them. The rank\none is 12:00 noon, where 711 users are highlighted in bright yellow.\nThis is your prime time, and the rankings tell you exactly when to\nschedule your most important messages and campaigns. If you have a\ntime-sensitive promotion or announcement, sending it at 12:00 will reach\nthe most people at their most engaged moment. Even when compared to\n12:00, 655 users are available at 1:44. Even though it is just an 8%\ndecrease, this engagement on a higher scale will result in thousands of\nusers that are not engaged. This Optimizer makes these insights\ntransparent so that you can make data-driven scheduling decisions. The\ncore concept is the window activity charts. The Optimizer analyzes when\nyour users are most active during a 24-hour period. On the left, you\nwill see a visual breakdown of user distribution by time windows\ndisplayed in a pie chart showing user engagement segments across four\ndifferent time slots, such as 0 to 6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18\nhours, etc.. There is also a detailed bar chart that talks about the\nnumber of users over each hour, which showcases how many users are\nactive at what hour of the campaign that is being sent out. These\nmetrics are gold for campaign timing optimizations. The speaker explains\nwhat exactly the Optimizer does, including user distribution by time\nwindow. The detailed count can be a downloadable report where you can\nexport all the phone numbers, etc.. Executing these campaigns happens in\nthe campaign tab. There are two different ways in which this can be\nhandled. One is immediate campaigns, where you can send messages right\nnow to targeted users, or you can schedule the campaign by setting up a\nrecurring or future-dated campaign. For immediate campaigns, you will\nprovide details like a campaign ID, which is optional.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Optimizer.md"}},{"id":"kb/Optimizer.md::chunk::6","text":"an be a downloadable report where you can\nexport all the phone numbers, etc..

For immediate campaigns, you will\nprovide details like a campaign ID, which is optional. If you do not\nhave a campaign ID, a unique ID will be automatically generated. You can\nchoose between a free text message that you can send and a utility\ntemplate. Since they are not sending a marketing campaign, the 24-hour\nwindow targeting will happen automatically from a free text message that\nis coming on the Gupshup site. You can enter your text message, and then\nyou can have a target window for all the users that are there. Targeting\nis done by specifying at what hour how many users were active and\nsending the text message to those users to engage them better. The\nspeaker selects the hours they want the users to be targeted; these are\nthe peak hours that are highlighted in green. You can also add some test\nnumbers here to test it out and then send the campaigns, which will\nreach all the users who are in the hour bracket that is listed down. You\ncan also see the campaign history based on different campaigns that have\nbeen executed, as well as different entries that show all the campaign\nnames, which can be a downloaded report as well. The Optimizer has a\ntracking capability where all the different file details or identifiers\nare available, and each row represents a completed or in-progress\ncampaign. This actually serves multiple things: you can maintain a\ncomplete audit trail of all the campaigns that are sent, analyze the\ntemplates and times across different performances, and learn what worked\nto adjust future campaigns accordingly. In the environment with active\ncampaigns, you see metrics like delivery rate, engagement rate, and\nresponse rate per campaign, allowing you to continuously refine your\nmessage strategy as well. That is all about the Optimizer.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Optimizer.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::0","text":"# Personalize","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::1","text":"## Profile & Database Management","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::2","text":"## Events Timeline Analysis","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::3","text":"## List & Segment Management","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::4","text":"## Custom Profile Properties\nHi there. This is a quick demo of Gupshop\\'s Personalize module. So\nwhenever we want to navigate to our customer data, we can click on\nPersonalize, and there are three, in fact, four tabs. In the Guide\nsection, you can get a quick access to the official documentations,\nwherein the document can help you guide on how to create lists,\nsegments, how to create new profile properties, and what is the overall\nuse of profiles. In the All Profile section, you can have a bird\\'s eye\nview of your complete database. You can have a look on your profiles.\nYou can also have a look on the total number of profiles, how many are\nactive on a monthly basis, and what is the total number of mobile\nnumbers available. Similar information in a graphical manner, and a few\nshortcuts of other modules that are present. So you can access Campaign\nManager, you can access Bot Studio, you can access Integrations, and\nalso click to WhatsApp ads. And again, a list of all the users that are\ncurrently there on the console. So if at all I click on any one of these\nusers, for example, I can get two types of information. Number one, I\ncan get their information or also see what lists and segments are they a\npart of. I can also see their profile properties as well. I can quickly\nupdate it, delete it, or in fact, add new information as well. Some\nsystem-generated information, wherein when was this profile created,\nwhen was it last active, and all of that, and all the console events\nthat will be present on the right-hand side. So this is the Events\nTimeline, wherein you can see all the events that the person is\nperforming. So let\\'s say if they have received a campaign, you will be\nable to see that event. You can see whether the message was delivered to\nthem or not, whether did they read it or not, if at all the user\\'s read\nevents are on. You can also see if at all they clicked on any button or\nnot. In fact, you can also see if at all there is any third-party\nintegration through which any events are coming from any external system\nlike CleverTap, MoEngage, or even the website directly. You can also\nhave a bird\\'s eye view of those events as well. So events like sign-up,\nproduct purchase, page browse, page load, and all of those events can\nalso become a part of this Events Timeline. The second tab is Lists and\nSegments, wherein you can do two things. Either you can import and\nexport data onto the Gupshup console by simply clicking on \\\"Create a\nnew list\\\". Give it some name, create. You can also download a sample\nfile to match the format. And if at all you have the file ready in the\nrequired format, you can simply browse it and simply select it. Click on\n\\\"Save,\\\" and then the list will get updated in a few minutes with all\nthe data in the list. The second thing is","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::5","text":"rein you can do two things.

Click on\n\\\"Save,\\\" and then the list will get updated in a few minutes with all\nthe data in the list. The second thing is segment creation, which is\nbasically used for targeted marketing. So there are two options in the\ntoast message: \\\"Create static segment,\\\" which does not update by\nitself, or you can also create a \\\"Dynamic segment,\\\" which can update\non a daily basis. So if at all I click on \\\"Dynamic segment,\\\" I can\nclick on \\\"Next\\\". I can give it a name, and then in the definition, I\ncan start defining the criteria which needs to be a part of the segment.\nSo there are two logics: either it can be \\\"Properties about someone,\\\"\nwherein you can filter out on the basis of a person\\'s profile property.\nSo you can simply select, let\\'s say in this case, I select \\\"Gender\\\"\nshould be equal to or should contain (there are several values over\nhere: \\\"contains,\\\" \\\"does not contain,\\\" \\\"ends with,\\\" \\\"starts\nwith\\\"). So in this case, I\\'ll say \\\"equal to,\\\" and then I can enter\nthe value; let\\'s say I say \\\"Male\\\". I can also add \\\"and\\\" or \\\"or\\\"\nconditions and simply choose another property. Let\\'s say in this case,\nI select \\\"City\\\" equals to \\\"Delhi\\\". Then I can click on \\\"Preview\nsegment\\\" and then I can create a segment, and then this segment can be\nused for campaigning. It can be used to run automated campaigns,\nbasically send out different kinds of messages which can be targeted\ntowards their activities. The second type of filtration can be done on\nthe basis of \\\"What someone has done or not done,\\\" which is basically\nevents. So you can simply select the source. The source can again be on\nthe basis of a custom integration, wherein third-party events are coming\nfrom an external source, which could be a website or any other tool like\nCleverTap or MoEngage, or any system could be an app as well, or they\ncan also be on the basis of WhatsApp events. So in this case, if at all\nI select \\\"WhatsApp,\\\" I can now see and I can create a segment of all\nthe people who might have read or not read a given campaign. So let\\'s\nsay we are trying to get a list of all the users who read a campaign,\nwho read a recent campaign that we deployed. So you can simply say\n\\\"Count of messages read at least once\\\" overall time. It can also be on\nthe basis of dates as well. In this case, I\\'ll say \\\"Overall time,\\\"\nand I can also add a filter, wherein I can filter it on the basis of\n\\\"Campaign ID,\\\" and then you can simply enter the Campaign ID which","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/Personalize.md::chunk::6","text":"read a given campaign.

In this case, I\\'ll say \\\"Overall time,\\\"\nand I can also add a filter, wherein I can filter it on the basis of\n\\\"Campaign ID,\\\" and then you can simply enter the Campaign ID which was\nused in the broadcasting so that the filtration can be done on the basis\nof that Campaign ID. Secondly, it can also be done on the basis of\nthird-party events, as I mentioned before. So I can select a custom\nintegration, I can select an event. Then I can select the frequency,\noverall time, and then I can preview segment and then create a segment.\nThe third tab is Profile Properties, wherein you can see all the profile\nproperties that are there on the console. There are two types: primary\nand custom. Primary are all the system profiles that are always there by\ndefault. And the custom profiles are the ones that a user creates by\nthemselves to capture additional information. You can always add a new\nproperty like this. Give it some kind of a name; in this case, let\\'s\nsay let\\'s call it a \\\"Sign-up Date\\\". And then you can select the data\ntype. In this case, it\\'s going to be \\\"Date,\\\" and you can simply click\non \\\"Save\\\". And the profile gets created. And now, every time you\nupload a list, and in the list, the sign-up date has a value, that value\nwill get mapped against the sign-up date of the person\\'s profile. So\nthis is a quick overview of Personalize and how to use Personalize in\nbots. Here\\'s a small example for a demo journey, wherein you can\ntrigger a bot by saying this particular keyword. You can ask somebody\nthese types of questions. The response momentarily needs to be stored in\na variable. These are all string variables. And then you can call that\nvariable in the Personalized node by simply selecting that specific\nproperty and calling that value of the variable in the value section. So\nas soon as a person starts this journey and then they start answering\nthese questions, all these values, the responses, will get mapped\nagainst their personalized profile properties. So this is how you use\nGupshup\\'s Personalized module to capture and populate more and more\ncustomer data and then segment it, and then which can be used for\ntargeted marketing.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Personalize.md"}},{"id":"kb/RCS.md::chunk::0","text":"# RCS","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/RCS.md"}},{"id":"kb/RCS.md::chunk::1","text":"## RCS Bot Branding & Verification","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/RCS.md"}},{"id":"kb/RCS.md::chunk::2","text":"## Transactional vs Promotional Type","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/RCS.md"}},{"id":"kb/RCS.md::chunk::3","text":"## Rich Card & Template Creation","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/RCS.md"}},{"id":"kb/RCS.md::chunk::4","text":"## Scheduling RCS Campaigns\nHello everyone. So today we will be talking about the RCS extension\nunder the console panel. So to access the RCS you can simply go to the\nextensions part and over there you can simply find an RCS extension. By\njust tapping over there you can get to the \"My Bots\" creation. So under\n\"My Bot,\" you need to create the identification of the brand. So when we\nsay a bot, so over here we mean that we are configuring the description\nabout the brand, and that's what exactly is going to be depicted over\nthe end customer's UI or the mobile device as an RCS message. So to\ncreate a bot, once we go to the RCS \"My Bot\" section, on the left-hand\nside you can make the customization, and on the right-hand side you can\nsee the preview which the end customer will get. So over here, the first\npart is to select the region. So you can select India or rest of the\nworld. Then we need to configure the message type. So it can be either\ntransactional. So under transactional, you might be able to send out the\nalerts or notification kind of messages. Under promotional, you can send\nout the sales or marketing-related messages, you know, where you are\npromoting any of your product or services, something like that. And\nunder OTP, a one-time password message can be sent out to the customer.\nRight? Just below, there is a bot creation mode which gives us an option\nof auto and manual. So let's take an example where you want you have an\nactive agent and you want to use the platform as a messaging. Maps, we\ncall it Messaging as a Platform. So you can simply create it as an auto\nmode. Otherwise, you can select the manual mode. Right. Right? So on the\nbasis of the use case, we can definitely define that how it should work.\nThen just below, there is a billing category where you can have a\nbilling type like a conversational or non-conversational. By the name,\nit might be giving a suggestion that conversational is when we are\nestablishing a two-way communication and to and fro of messages are\nhappening. So we can put it under conversational, and non-conversational\nis where you are just sending out a simple template. Right? Just below,\nyou can start giving the bot description like bot name. So on the\nright-hand side under preview, we can see where the bot name will be.\nThen we can have the brand name. Right. Then just below, we can have the\nlogo. We can directly upload it from the system. So this is how the logo\nwill be. Then we can have the banner image. Right? Then we can have the\nshort description around the brand. We can select the color palette for\nthe, you know, the text. Then just below, we can add the number so that\nthe customer can reach us out. We can add the email ID. We can also add\nthe website URL.

And just below there are terms and conditions. So this\nis very much mandatory in the RCS world. We need to update, you know,\npaste the URL of our terms and conditions and privacy policies. And just\nbelow the API options is available. So two types of APIs are being\nworked. One is the GSMA API, and the other one is the Google RBM API. So\nas per the development, we can decide. Then we have the web hook, like\nhow the message should be there. And then we have the language\nsupported. So of course, since we are able to send out on a global\nlevel, we can select different languages. And once we are satisfied how\nthe description should be, we can simply submit, we can simply agree and\nsubmit it to Google for the verification. So once the template is\nverified, right, once sorry, once the bot is verified, it will be shown\nover here, and the type of bot which we have created. So I have already\ncreated a promotional one. I'll just use this. So it will give us the\nbot dashboard that how the company description is like, and just below\nwe have this information. Now just to create a template under it, right,\nthe promotional bot we have created. Now we need to create a template,\nright. So we can have a template code. You can select the template type\nwhether it should be a rich card, standalone, rich card, carousel, text\nmessage, or media. Right? Then we can have the card details that how it\nshould be vertical or horizontal. Right? So we can set how the image\nshould be showcased. Then we can also select the height, like short or\nmedium. Just below, we have the feasibility to upload it from the\nsystem. Then we can give the card title. Right? And then we can give the\ncard description. Right? And in case we want to make it personalized, of\ncourse, we can have the integration in place and we can, you know, add\nthe variable, and like these kind of information can automatically be,\nyou know, fetched from the system. Then we again simply by submitting an\napproval to Google. Once the template is created, it will be added under\nthe bot, and from there we can directly trigger the campaign.

For\nexample, if you want to and if you are an e-com company, you will get to\nsee that the starting templates are already pre-created in the system.\n\nYou can always go and use these templates as it is.

Meta also subjects the right to\nchange the content category or sorry, template category based on the\ncontent you have provided. So if you\\'re trying to get a utility, sorry,\nmarketing template get approved in the utility.\n\nYou will get to see that there is an option wherein if you opt in that\nif the content falls in the linear category, Meta has an access to\nchange that and then update or approve that template under some other\ncategory also. So here, the all the newly supported template types are\nall available, whether it\\'s about custom message, product message,\ncarousels, LTO. So whatever the newly launched templates are there by\nMeta, you will get to see all of that already incorporated in a\nplatform.\n\nSimply select the category, choose the language you want to send, give a\ntemplate label. This is important. So it is basically to review Meta\nwhat kind of template you are going to send to customer.\n\nIf there is any promotional marketing message, ensure that you define it\nhere saying that marketing, promotional, all those keywords. You know\nthat Meta allows you to send out what you can send actually rich media\ntemplates on WhatsApp. So whether it\\'s a text image, video document\nlocation, you simply can choose a header.\n\nAnd let\\'s say if you choose an image as a header, at this point of\ntime, it\\'s important for you to provide the sample media file also. So\nneedless, not needless if the file is going to be the same when you do\nthe real campaign or not. But at the moment, you have to actually upload\na sample file.\n\nSame goes to body while you are creating a template, you always have an\noption to add multiple variables. For example, if you want to\npersonalize for customer name, right, you already have a database where\nyou have name of the customers, you can create templates with some\nvariable fields so that at the runtime when you are running the\ncampaign, you always can map these fields with the right attributes. In\ncase if you don\\'t have any of the attributes or any of the details\navailable at the runtime, it will still you will still be able to use a\ntemplate by defining a default value.\n\nFor example, for those customers whose names are not there in your\ndatabase, you can simply define a callback as customer. And to those\nwhose names are already there, it will get get mapped and go to them\nlike that.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Template Manager.md"}},{"id":"kb/Template Manager.md::chunk::3","text":"## Content Formatting & Media\nTo ensure that the template you\\'re creating has, you know,\nlooks the look and feel of the template, the content you share is very\naesthetic, you will have the features here like making the statement as\nbold, italic, strikethrough, you also have bullet points and number\noptions available.\n\nAnd whatever total maximum char limit you can write a template for, you\nwill get to see it here. So if you you see that if you try to write\nsomething and it is extending beyond the template character count, it\nwill give you an error here itself.

Quick reply\nbasically helps customer to or maybe whatever response you want to\ncollect from the customer. As a user response, you can use quick reply.\n\nAnd CTAs are used when you want to redirect the customer to a specific\nURL, phone number, or let\\'s say if you want to give any offer code,\nwhen clicking on a button, a particular offer code can be copied. Within\nthe URL itself, we have two options again, if whether that, you know,\nURL can be static, which means one same URL can be will be gone to all\nthe broadcast list you are sharing, or the or the URL can also be\ndynamic, you can define the dynamic URL and while you are sending the\ncampaign at the runtime, you can map the variable here. And you also\nhave an option to track that.\n\nSo in case if you want to see that who has clicked on that CTA, you can\nactually choose the option dynamic link with tracking. Now at the end of\nthis, you can see that you will get to see preview and submit. Once you\nclick on preview and submit in case if those fields are not selected or\nmapped, it will not let you to go forward.\n\nAnd once you finish all the steps, you will be able to go forward and\nsubmit the template. So yeah, this is how typically you do that. And\nonce you submit the template, you will come back to the home screen\nautomatically.\n\nAnd it will show you that the template is in a submitted status. The\nmoment you know the template gets approved, it will automatically get\napproved here.

But what you can do is that you can\nsimply go here and click on edit template. By default, any of the\ntemplate which is rejected or approved can be edited two times.\n\nBut you can always create a clone of the template and create a new\ntemplate ID.

You\\'ll also have some other sort options wherein you can sort\nthe template or name last updated and created on.\n\nAnd then you can actually let\\'s say if you want to change this filter\nfrom ascending to descending, you can do that.

And on\ntop of it, you can choose a template category. For example, at this\npoint of time, we want to see what other marketing templates are\navailable.\n\nAnd on that as well, you have an option of selecting the template type.\nFor example, you want to see that what whichever marketing template had\na video message attached to it, you simply can click here.

To do a\nWhatsApp campaign, you click on Campaign Manager and select broadcast.\nThis is where you can see all of your existing campaigns in such a\nmanner. You can also filter them based on sent, drafts, expired,\nscheduled, et cetera. For example, I click on \"all\". I can click on \"new\nbroadcast campaign\". The toast message pops up. I can select \"one way\"\nin this case and I'll select \"next\". Now I'll give it a name. Let's call\nit \"campaign demo\". The next step is to select an audience. Either you\ncan upload a list or a segment that exists on the platform's\npersonalization section. You can send it to all the users as well, or\nyou can also upload a list. There's an option which says \"download\nsample\". And this is what a sample file looks like. Over here you can\nsee the first column is phone number, which is mandatory, and the\nsubsequent fields can be added for further personalization. In this\ncase, I have added customer name and a link because I'm also going to be\ncovering how dynamic link tracking is done. I'll close this file. In the\nupload test section, I'll click on \"choose file\". But before that, I'll\nalso enable link tracking. And now I'll upload my file like this. Once\nthat is done, you get a success message and the total number of rows\nthat exist in the file. I'll also check this disclaimer. The next step\nis to select a template. In this case, let's say I'll select this \"copy\none time offer\" template. I'll select this. The fourth step is to\npreview the campaign, where you set up the template. First of all, offer\nexpiry. Let's say I'll add a fallback value over here, which is going to\nbe, \"when should the offer expire?\". I'll say 14th, maybe. And then what\nshould be the button value? Again, I'll select a fallback value like\nthis. And over here, I'll say this is an offer for 50% off. So I'll say\n\"50 off\". On the next step, this is the last step where you can preview\nthe campaign to see whether everything looks good or not. And if\neverything is fine, you can either send it now, schedule it for later by\nselecting a date and time. And then we also have an option of a\nrecurring campaign. If at all it's a campaign that's meant to be sent at\nmultiple days of the week, you can actually repeat it at a specific\ntime.

And in this case, let's say\nthis is one of the campaigns that I sent earlier. I can click on this,\nand this is how the analytics look like. So if at all there's a button\nin the template, it also shows the click analysis. It also shows how\nmany users were targeted, whether the message was submitted on Meta or\nnot. Was it directly sent to the end user, and was it finally delivered\nto the user or not? Click analysis: how many clicks were made? How many\nnumber of unique clicks? And if at all I scroll down, there are two\nparameters over here. One is the response file, and one is the link\ntracking report. So I can click on \"response file,\" and the system will\ndownload this file for me, which I can open. This is where you can see\nwhether the message was sent or not. In case it was failed, it also\nshows the reason of failure like this. So there are multiple fields\nwhich says accordingly. Campaign ID, the phone numbers, the channel on\nwhich you reach out to the customer, what was the template name, whether\nthe validation was success or not. And then you can also see failure\nreason in case of failure of delivery, and the delivery status in this\ncase was delivered. When was it delivered? And all the time stamps will\nbe available over here. I can close this and I can also see the this uh\nlink tracking report of this campaign as well. Say, for example, I click\non this \"link tracking report\". Again, the system downloads it for me. I\nclick on this. This is where you can see whether the person clicked onto\nthe link or not. And you can also see the time stamp. So again, the\ncampaign ID, the original URL, which was there in the sheet, which was\nthere in this particular excel. Gap URL, the phone number which clicked\non the uh which clicked on the URL or not. What browser was it, what was\nthe IP, what was the device, and ultimately the click time stamp. So\nthis is how you can do a WhatsApp broadcast campaign and how you can\ntrack the analytics of the campaign and track how many people received\nthe message, how many people clicked on any buttons if there were any,\nand how, at what time did they interact with the message.","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/WA Campaign manager.md"}},{"id":"kb/WA.md::chunk::0","text":"# WA","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/WA.md"}},{"id":"kb/WA.md::chunk::1","text":"## Managing WhatsApp Opt-ins","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/WA.md"}},{"id":"kb/WA.md::chunk::2","text":"## Profile & Account Details","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/WA.md"}},{"id":"kb/WA.md::chunk::3","text":"## Webhook Configuration","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/WA.md"}},{"id":"kb/WA.md::chunk::4","text":"## Account Health & Stream Updates\nHello everyone, welcome to yet another session on Gupshup Conversation\nCloud stack and today we'll discuss how brands can manage their WhatsApp\nprofile through the platform. So, once you are logged in, you have to\nnavigate to Channels. Under Channels, you have to go under WhatsApp, and\nthere you see multiple tabs. The first tab is Opt-in, which is a user\nguide to manage opt-ins or to get opt-ins from the user. Because it's\nnecessary for a brand to get opt-ins to reach out to their users for any\nconversation or communications, right? So, there are multiple ways how\nyou can start managing opt-ins. One is the business-managed mechanism,\nwhere it can be through a short link, as you can see. It's a \"wa.me\"\nlink, or it can be a QR code which can be generated by a business to\nmanage opt-ins. And then there is the Gupshup-managed mechanism, where\nwe have opt-in and opt-out APIs. These can be configured to manage the\ndatabase of users who have opted in for future conversations with the\nbrands. Now there are some smart mechanisms to get opt-ins from the\nusers. There are multiple strategies to begin with. You can have a QR\ncode embedded, and this QR code can be on a banner. It can be on any\nphysical purview where you can have a QR code embed. Once a user will\nscan the QR code, they will be landed to a WhatsApp screen and then can\nstart engaging with the brands, right? Or you can have a web visit on a\nwebsite. Once the user clicks on that, you can get opt-ins. And then the\nother way is to have it on a URL to initiate a WhatsApp chat. And there\nis a provision from Gupshup to get opt-ins on SMS as well. A user can\nsend a message in the format like this. Okay, where the keyword will be\n\"opt-in\" and then the app ID, right? These are some numbers provided\nwhere users can send. And brands can start getting the opt-in database\nof opt-in users. Now, I'll move to Profile, where business can see their\ndetails. Like business description, under which category the account has\nbeen created, what's the business website, right? And this is basically\nlike WhatsApp Business account details. They can see WhatsApp Business\nAccount ID, phone number, and then they can see contact details. This is\nbasically required by Gupshup to connect with the brands. So here brands\nwill see the email ID, contact number, and contact name for\ncommunications, right? Moving to webhooks, basically, these are like\ncallback URLs. These are required if brands need to get events. These\nevents can be message events. Like if the message has been sent and the\nbusiness wants to capture that, so they can give a webhook name and the\ncallback URL. Gupshup will send that event back to the brands, right? So\nthere are multiple message events like sent, delivered, read, delete,\nand","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/WA.md"}},{"id":"kb/WA.md::chunk::5","text":"nd contact name for\ncommunications, right?

So\nthere are multiple message events like sent, delivered, read, delete,\nand so forth, right? Similarly, there are some system events, like\ntemplate events or account-related events. So, any information that\nbrands need on the callback URL, this is the place where it is\nconfigured. Right. Moving to Account, this is a place where brands can\ntrack their overall WhatsApp Business Account. They can know whether\nthey are on an MM-lite or they are still a non-MM-lite type. Right. And\nthen they can see overall account details, like phone number, what's the\nentity name, display name, etc.. And on top of it, they can see the\noverall health of the WhatsApp account, right? So, they can see the\naccount status, whether it's active or not active, what's the Docker\nstatus, messaging limit, what's the phone quality? Right. And all these\nthings are very important because it lets brands know how customers are\ninteracting with their messages. Because sometimes what happens,\ncustomers also block you or mark you as spam, right? So it's very\nimportant that you keep track of your overall health. And then this is\nthe Account Update Stream where brands can see updates on their account.\nBecause as the speaker said, if customers are marking you as spam or\nblocking you, there will be some actions taken by the brand, right? And\nthis is where brands can track. For example, if I take this account\nupdate as an event type, I can see what actions have been taken. So, I\ncan see there was some ban imposed on the account and then it's been in\nstate. Okay. On a specific date, right? Similarly, you can see other\nupdates as well. Okay. For example, somebody has, like there can be\nmultiple reports on marking this account as spam, right? So, you can see\nthere was some violation info and Meta has taken some action, right? So,\nlikewise brands can also track their accounts. Yeah. So, the speaker\nbelieves that's it for this session. Thank you very much for joining.\nSee you in the next.

Today we\\'ll discuss on how brands can leverage web as a\nchannel in their overall omnichannel strategy. So once you are logged in\non the platform navigate to channels. Under channels, move to web. And\nhere, you can see you\\'ll find a URL. So once you have created a journey\non a on the platform under Bot Studio, in Bot Studio basically under\nuser journeys and you clicked on save and deploy, you can simply embed\nthis particular URL on the web page where you want to basically activate\nthis bot. So this is basically where, like there is a installation steps\nhere as well. You simply have to embed this URL. Now, you\\'ll see two\noptions here: settings and test. Settings are basically where you want\nto configure the bot, and there are multiple things that you want to\nactivate on a bot. I\\'ll start with chat aesthetics. So this is where\nyou basically configure look and feel of the overall bot. So you can see\nlike there are multiple options available here for brands, for example,\nbot name. So whatever bot name you will give here, you can see in the\npreview. Okay, then comes to bot avatar. So there are multiple avatars\navailable here, and you can upload if you want to like upload another\nlike custom avatar, and you can see the avatar will be displayed here.\nNow, colors. Under colors, you can choose various colors. Like header\ncolor is basically where you can see like at the top right what should\nbe the header color. You can configure background color of the chatbot\nmessage color. Like you can see this color you can give to the bot\nreply. You can configure color for a user message, like you can see on\nthe preview here. Similarly, you can set font. So, there are a few\nstyles which come out of the box, and even if you want to give choose a\ncustom style, you can do that by giving font family and font URL. Okay,\nand then you can configure chat widget. So you can choose whether the\nwidget should be small, medium, large. What should be the position?\nShould the icon of the bot should appear on the right or should it\nappear on the left etc.? Right? You can choose the icon. So here, you\ncan see, right, there\\'s icon selected here. Similarly, you can choose\nthe size whether it should be small, medium, large, etc.. Right? So\nthese are the configuration that you can enable on the UI piece. Then\nI\\'ll move to greetings where basically you can configure the greeting\nmessage from the bot. For example, here you can if you want to choose,\nyou want to put some image, you can do that. And then you can basically\nwrite a custom message. Okay. For example, I\\'m writing to Gupshup. And\nif you want to like have buttons on top of it, you can do that as well.\nFor example, \\\"inte","source":{"repo":"sharmaadwit/kb_docs","branch":"main","path":"kb/Web.md"}},{"id":"kb/Web.md::chunk::6","text":"So\nthese are the configuration that you can enable on the UI piece.

And\nif you want to like have buttons on top of it, you can do that as well.\nFor example, \\\"interested,\\\" \\\"show more,\\\" etc.. Right? So these are\nbasically the greeting message that the user will see once they want to\nlike start a conversation with the brand. Right? Now I\\'ll move to\npre-chat form which is basically the first thing that the user will see.\nOkay. So you can enable that. So there is a button here, and these are\nbasically you can see as a use case you can like take it as getting\nconsent from the user. Okay. So for example, once users wants to chat\nwith the brand and you want to get a consent, you can have a pre- chat\nform here where you can upload an image. There\\'s a placeholder for\nthat. And then you have a header where you can basically write something\nin the header section. Then you have a subheader section where you can\nwrite about, for example, consent information. It can be as simple as\nthat. Okay. And then you can configure checkbox text which is basically\nthis particular section where you can give a text. Then you can give a\nhyperlink text here and then the URL for that hypertext, where if\nsomebody wants to like, for example, here, in terms and condition, you\ncan see that there is a hyperlink you can activate. So if somebody wants\nto go and read terms and condition, which is redirection to a website,\nthe user can do that. Correct? And then there is a global button text\nwhich is basically here, for context in the preview, it is \\\"get\nstarted.\\\" So this is how you can configure a pre-chat form. I\\'ll move\nto the persistent menu, which is basically main information of a\nbusiness is a main menu, right? So here, you can see, right, I have\nconfigured a reply button and a URL. Similarly, like there are two\nthings that you can add to a menu: it is either a reply button or a URL,\nand that will be persistent here. So if somebody clicks on\n\\\"interested,\\\" you can basically have a payload here. Okay. For\nexample, this one, and you can trigger a journey on top of it. And then\nyou can have a URL where which is basically a redirection. Okay. And\nthen there are some preferences that you can store. For example, you can\nenable or disable customer chat history. So if you want to retain\ncustomer chat history, you simply have to enable this feature. Okay. And\nthen there is some security checks that you can enable.

So this is\nhow you can control not just the UI piece of the overall web experience,\nbut you can control security preferences persistent menu, and so forth.\nRight? So this is where you control the overall chat experience through\nGupshup Conversational Cloud. So that\\'s all about this session. Thank\nyou for joining. See you in next.
