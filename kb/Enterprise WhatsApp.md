Hello everyone, thank you for joining and I\'m really glad to help you

Enterprise extensions in the console of Gupshop. Okay, so here is the
main page of the console and you can find the Enterprise WhatsApp
extensions here in the left corner. You have the module called
extensions and you just need to click it here in Enterprise WhatsApp.

## Opt-ins & Opt-outs

After that you can choose the service that you want to have more
information about the extension WhatsApp and you will be redirected to
this page. So basically here in Enterprise WhatsApp we have 10 tabs
where you can have more information about your Enterprise WhatsApp
number, have a dashboard information, messaging, emails, opt-ins,
opt-outs, templates, QR logs, your account and integrations. So we\'re
going to have a very simple overview about all of those tabs and like we
can like load those pages here.

## Messaging Capabilities (Simple/Bulk)

I will start here in the messaging one where you can have more
information about the messages of the WhatsApp Enterprise extension. So
basically here you have three types of messaging that you can send to
your customers. So you can send a simple message to these customers, so
you can choose here the text, if it\'s going to be an image, a document,
a video, a location one and you can choose those options here.

So you can put it here the numbers separated by commas that you want to
engage in this message. So for example I can put it here like my number
and if I want to send another for another number I just need to put it
here and put it a comma to separate those numbers as well. So I put it
here a number, you put it here like let me just put here a text one.

So I just need to select the template that I want to send to my customer
so I can search it here, I can refresh or I can click it here and choose
this template that I have here already in place. So I will put it here

information to my customer. So basically you just need to click here to

So here you have the simple message, you can send it a bulk message to
your customer. So you just need to select here the template, when you

list of phone numbers since it\'s a bulk one, so you need just to choose
the archive, the file, the maximum file size it\'s 20 megabytes and here
you have three options, remove duplicate entries, so if I have more than
the same one like a duplicated one I can remove it, I can enable link
tracking if I have a link in the template and I can send interactive
buttons enable the template when I want to, I don\'t know, like send a
quick reply message, a quick reply template to your customer.
