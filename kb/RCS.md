## Rich Card & Template Creation

## Scheduling RCS Campaigns

Hello everyone. So today we will be talking about the RCS extension
under the console panel. So to access the RCS you can simply go to the
extensions part and over there you can simply find an RCS extension. By
just tapping over there you can get to the "My Bots" creation. So under
"My Bot," you need to create the identification of the brand. So when we
say a bot, so over here we mean that we are configuring the description
about the brand, and that's what exactly is going to be depicted over
the end customer's UI or the mobile device as an RCS message. So to
create a bot, once we go to the RCS "My Bot" section, on the left-hand
side you can make the customization, and on the right-hand side you can
see the preview which the end customer will get. So over here, the first
part is to select the region. So you can select India or rest of the
world. Then we need to configure the message type. So it can be either
transactional. So under transactional, you might be able to send out the
alerts or notification kind of messages. Under promotional, you can send
out the sales or marketing-related messages, you know, where you are
promoting any of your product or services, something like that. And
under OTP, a one-time password message can be sent out to the customer.
Right? Just below, there is a bot creation mode which gives us an option
of auto and manual. So let's take an example where you want you have an
active agent and you want to use the platform as a messaging. Maps, we
call it Messaging as a Platform. So you can simply create it as an auto
mode. Otherwise, you can select the manual mode. Right. Right? So on the
basis of the use case, we can definitely define that how it should work.
Then just below, there is a billing category where you can have a
billing type like a conversational or non-conversational. By the name,
it might be giving a suggestion that conversational is when we are
establishing a two-way communication and to and fro of messages are
happening. So we can put it under conversational, and non-conversational
is where you are just sending out a simple template. Right? Just below,
you can start giving the bot description like bot name. So on the
right-hand side under preview, we can see where the bot name will be.
Then we can have the brand name. Right. Then just below, we can have the
logo. We can directly upload it from the system. So this is how the logo
will be. Then we can have the banner image. Right? Then we can have the
short description around the brand. We can select the color palette for
the, you know, the text. Then just below, we can add the number so that
the customer can reach us out. We can add the email ID. We can also add
the website URL. And just below there are terms and conditions. So this
is very much mandatory in the RCS world. We need to update, you know,
paste the URL of our terms and conditions and privacy policies. And just
below the API options is available. So two types of APIs are being
worked. One is the GSMA API, and the other one is the Google RBM API. So
as per the development, we can decide. Then we have the web hook, like
how the message should be there. And then we have the language
supported. So of course, since we are able to send out on a global
level, we can select different languages. And once we are satisfied how
the description should be, we can simply submit, we can simply agree and
submit it to Google for the verification. So once the template is
verified, right, once sorry, once the bot is verified, it will be shown
over here, and the type of bot which we have created. So I have already
created a promotional one. I'll just use this. So it will give us the
bot dashboard that how the company description is like, and just below
we have this information. Now just to create a template under it, right,
the promotional bot we have created. Now we need to create a template,
right. So we can have a template code. You can select the template type
whether it should be a rich card, standalone, rich card, carousel, text
message, or media. Right? Then we can have the card details that how it
should be vertical or horizontal. Right? So we can set how the image
should be showcased. Then we can also select the height, like short or
medium. Just below, we have the feasibility to upload it from the
system. Then we can give the card title. Right? And then we can give the
card description. Right? And in case we want to make it personalized, of
course, we can have the integration in place and we can, you know, add
the variable, and like these kind of information can automatically be,
you know, fetched from the system. Then we again simply by submitting an
approval to Google. Once the template is created, it will be added under
the bot, and from there we can directly trigger the campaign. In case
you want to test, right, you can have a test device added over here by
simply adding the number. Right. And once it is there, you can simply,
you know, send a single text or sorry, RCS message to the customer.
Right? Now if you want to run a campaign, so we can simply go to the
campaign section, add new campaign. You can select the bot whatever you
have created. I'll just select the promotional and the template under
it. Right. Once you are fine with the bot and template, we can schedule
the campaign. Right now it gives us the liberty and flexibility to
select between different time zones and select with the exact timeline.
If we select run later, it gives us to, you know, option to select the
date, the campaign hours, seconds, minutes, AM, and PM. So we can
customize this. And once we click on submit, the campaign will be
scheduled. Right?

## RCS Analytics & Traffic Insight

So once the campaign has been scheduled, there's another option of
analytics. Now here you will provide a complete in-depth analytics
around whatever has happened in the dashboard. So, so over here you can
set the analytics timeline, like from which particular timeline you want
the information to be extracted. Then there are certain filters around
the countries, carriers, carriers like T-Mo and different zones are
there or any other window. Right. Then there are bots, the bot types. So
all these filters will be there. Once you click on search, it will give
you a summary around the basic messages application to peer, single
message application to peer conversation, and peer-to-application
conversation. So all this kind of analytics will be there. And just
below that, you will get also an idea around the brand name, transaction
type, basic message. These will be the numbers, A2P single message, A2P
conversation. So again these numbers will be there for you. Then you can
also have a traffic dashboard. Again certain filters are there for your
reference. And just below you can find the details around like what is
the time message submitted, message sent, message delivered, message
read, message failed, message revoked, expired, delivery rate, read
rate, P2A response, P2A response rate, P2A message. So such kind of
information you can extract from here. In case you want to export in a
CSV, you can directly export it out. Then you have the detailed reports.
Right. So this is nothing like whatever thing has happened. Right. So
these are something which we have customized, but over here you get a to
and fro or like a complete end-to-end analytics around the messaging
part. So you can simply make a download in a CSV format and it will be
there. Then again you can play around with your own filters and extract
the information relevant to you.
