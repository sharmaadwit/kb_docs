## Icebreakers & Persistent Menus

## Implementing Autoresponders

Hello everyone, welcome to yet another session on Gupshup conversational
cloud stack. Today we\'ll discuss on how brands can leverage Instagram
in their omni channel strategies. So once you are logged on on the on
the platform, you have to navigate to Channels. Under Channels there is
a module called Instagram. You have to select it and once the
connection, when I say connection it\'s basically linking Gupshup
platform with your Instagram accounts, been done, you\'ll be able to see
two tabs here: Instagram settings and App settings. Under App App
settings you will see all the configuration which have app name, app
key, and app ID. And then you will see a button to unlink this account.
I\'ll come back to the Instagram settings because this is where the
magic happens and brands can start leveraging WhatsApp to engage users.
And there are multiple ways to engage users on Instagram through Gupshup
platform. On the screen you can see two types here: Icebreakers and
Persistent Menu. So, Icebreakers are basically it\'s to help new user to
start a conversation with the brand. Okay. So, there will be a list of
frequently asked questions that you can configure here and it is like
you can have maximum of four question that can be set as a Icebreaker.
So, here on the screen you can see right there are four Icebreakers,
three Icebreakers created here and you can add a new one where you can
like give a name here \"learn more\" and then enter a payload. Correct.
And then if you want to add a reason specific Icebreakers then you can
like select for which specific reason or language you want to create a
locale and you can configure it here as well. So, this is how you
configure Icebreakers. I\'ll come back and I\'ll show you how to set up
Persistent Menu. Again, Persistent Menu is basically a menu of business
main features. Okay. So, if if uh if you will basically log to the
Instagram page of a business, you will see a hamburger icon here and
once you click on there you will see like a persistent menu. So, for
example, you can see there is a persistent menu already created,
\"Interested\". So, again if you want to create another such menu
you\'ll get an option to either configure a reply button or a URL. Okay.
So, reply button is basically to send a predefined text message on
behalf of the user. URL is basically to redirect user to external
website. So, if you want to like have a URL set up here, so you can say
\"Visit us\" and give a URL here which can be something like this. You
can click on save. You can see the success right. So, this is how like
there are two this is like two ways to start engaging with a user on
Instagram and then there is another way where you can basically
configure a autoresponder. Okay. So, autoresponders are basically single
message replies that a business can send to a user. If they for example
comment on business post or reply or react to the business stories or
maybe they mentioned the business Instagram handle in their own story so
and so forth right. So, if you come under Bot Studio and go under
journeys you\'ll see like I\'m going to show you. For example, you just
have to create a journey and this is a sample journey that I created for
this demo. Where the starting node can be an event, right? Which can be
a user event. And then I just write a simple code here where I\'m just
taking the message object type. So, this message object type can be
anything like a reply or a comment so and so forth. Right? So, I\'m just
storing that in a variable called \"autoresponder\". Now I have written
a small condition here like if that\'s equal to a reply or if it is
equal to reels comment or equals to reply to a story so and so forth I
will have a different or a differentiated experience for those users.
So, based on what is the user input they will see different responses.
So, this is how you can basically configure autoresponder on Instacart
right. So, yeah so like these are like strategies that business can
start implementing through our platform and start engaging with the
users on Instagram. So, that\'s it for this session. Thanks for joining.
If you need any other help you can refer to console docs dot gupshop dot
com gupshop dot io where we have documented the entire platform and
it\'s a user guide for the platform. Thanks. Thanks very much for
joining the session.
