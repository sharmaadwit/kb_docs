# Clear Context Node (Gupshup Dev Access Only)

**Module**: Bot Studio

## Definition
Clear Context Node is a special node accessible to Gupshup Developers only where the business logic requires to clear the previous journey stack after completion of a journey or at some other point. Clear Context node will delete the Journey stack which is created at backend to keep track of the journeys which user has traversed and switched the context midway.

## Procedure
### Exact UI path
Gupshup Console → Bot Studio → Clear Context Node (Gupshup Dev Access Only)

### Prerequisites
- Access to the relevant bot/project in Gupshup Console.
- A journey/app where you can test the configuration.

### Fields to configure
- No explicit fields were identified in the source; use the UI controls shown on this page.

### Steps
1. Open Gupshup Console.
2. Go to **Bot Studio**.
3. Go to **Clear Context Node (Gupshup Dev Access Only)**.
4. Click **Save** (or **Save & Deploy**) to apply changes.

### Validation / where to check
- Run the flow in **Test your Bot** and confirm the expected node/path executes.
- If the change must affect live traffic, use **Save & Deploy** and verify on the target channel.

### Troubleshooting
- If behavior is unchanged, confirm you updated the correct node and used **Save & Deploy** for live channels.
- If the wrong branch/path runs, re-check conditions, connected nodes, and fallback connectors.

### Save / publish / deploy behavior
- Click **Save** (or **Save & Deploy**) to apply changes.

### Setup path
- Go to **Bot Studio**.
- Go to **Clear Context Node (Gupshup Dev Access Only)**.

## Options / variants
- No explicit UI variants/toggles were identified in the source for this page.

## Field mapping / schemas
- No explicit payload/schema details were identified in the source for this page.

## Field/payload examples
- No explicit payload examples were identified in the source.

## Cross-module workflow docs
- Bot Studio journey → Channel go-live (WhatsApp/Instagram/Web)
- Bot Studio journey → Observability via Webhooks

## Module disambiguation docs
- **Save** stores changes; **Save & Deploy** publishes to live channels.
- Node configuration happens in **Bot Studio**; delivery/engagement metrics are typically in **Analytics/Insights**.

## Step-by-step configuration
# Introduction

Clear Context Node is a special node accessible to Gupshup Developers only where the business logic requires to clear the previous journey stack after completion of a journey or at some other point. Clear Context node will delete the Journey stack which is created at backend to keep track of the journeys which user has traversed and switched the context midway.

# Functional Details to Understand the Feature:

Journey Builder backend keeps track of the context of user journeys and maintains the same on a stack to ensure that the bot is able to hold the context even if the user switches it midway during a journey. The switching of context can happen due to a call and return journey being invoked or the user has invoked any other journey trigger keyword or intent. The clear context node when executed will clear out the stack and the user can also clear the Global Variables that are stored during the previous journey executions by checking the checkbox available on the node.
