## AI & FAQ Performance

Hi everyone, my name is Purushottam uh also known as Puru. I\'m part of
the pre-sales team. I lead the India West pre-sales along with Mel. Uh
in this video I\'m going to talk about the bot studio analytics as in
how does it help and what are things available on the platform. Right?
So in the in the previous videos I\'ve talked about journey builder,
WhatsApp flows. Uh people have talked about AI admin goals and other
things about bot studio. In this one we are specifically specifically
going to cover how does the analytics work over there. Let\'s quickly
get into there. All right. So as soon as you hit this talk hit this
section on B studio that is called analytics you get to see the
dashboard. There are different uh other views as well but I\'m going to
talk about dashboard first and move on this to this direction. So the on
the dashboard you\'ll be able to see the live matrices such as uh active
users or the total number of messages in last 120 minutes which is
nothing but the last two hours of them. Then you get to see the message
insights as in the total number of messages, the customer messages and
the bot messages. Okay, you are you are free to go ahead and select the
date range or the channel you want to see it for. So it could be with
WhatsApp or web or Instagram for that sake. You can select all of those
things just at one go. Now you might also be wondering what is this
40% - 41%? Well, this is nothing but uh the comparison of uh the total
for example let\'s take this the total number of messages in this date
range that is 19 to 26 which is this particular weeks or last 7 days
data has been 130 messages but if we compare to the previous 7 days
which is from I mean which is from the 19th to the last seven days which
could be 1 2 3 4 5 6. So 13 to 19th this data compared with 19th to 16th
that\'s what is being shown here. So I mean compared to the previous
week\'s data that this has gone down by 40%. Similar similarly are the
customer messages and similar are the bot messages over there. Okay. So
it gives the end user who is looking at this analytics dashboard what is
the traction the bot is bringing and how is it performing compared to
the previous week. So maybe the the bot designer or the campaign manager
has made certain changes to the bot orchestration or maybe there have
been campaigns on CPASS increased volume or reduced volume basis those
variables how does the interaction change in the bot that\'s something
which has been demonstrated here and then all of that data into tabular
format or let\'s say not the tabular format in a graphical format here
the number of messages versus the days over there. Then comes the
conversational insights total number of conversations and the average
message per per conversation. Now previous one was individual messages.
Here we are talking about let\'s say sessions like I come to the bot I
talk about four five things I ask different queries that\'s a
conversation. Okay so there are five conversations so far and the
average messages per conversation is 26. Now over here there\'s a uh
there\'s this matrix going down whereas this one is increasing. What
does it mean exactly? Well total conversations have gone down by 58%.
Well this means that compared to the previous date range this is lower.
This should have been higher whereas average messages have gone high.
Right? So customers are using the journey well the even when the
conversations have gone down but the average messages per conversation
has has increased drastically by 44%. As in people are more interested
in talking about a particular uh particular thing in a given
conversation. So less number of people but the people are more
interested. That\'s that\'s what you can make out of this matrix here.
Same thing in a graphical format here. This thing which I want to cover
is organic as in how many people are organically coming into the
platform and conversing with us. That\'s what it shows. And the third
matrix which you get on the dashboard is user insights. You get to see
how many are active users, how many are new users, how many are return
users over there and the average messages per user. So if you see on
this test uh account the active users have gone down. The new users have
gone down compared to the previous uh previous week. return users at are
at the same level 0%. But the average messages per user has increased by
29%. Which is which means that I mean although the active users or the
return users are less but the users who have come back within the six
and five 11 users they are conversing more with the bot. So maybe we we
have done something positive on the bot which is helping them to go
ahead and engage even better within with the customer with the bot over
there. Similarly, user trends into different graphical format. Let\'s
come to the conversational path. Again, you have the option of selecting
the date trains, the channels you want to see the you can uh drill down
to individual journey statistics if you want to see that. I mean, you
have built 10 different journeys. How is one journey performing? You can
go ahead and select that particular journey here. And that the data of
that particular journey would obviously apply here. Even you can define
the source whether you want it to be marketing look at the marketing
statistics basically you have sent out message on WhatsApp and RCAs and
other given channels what is the kind of uh traction coming in from
there. CTX as in C2WA what is the kind of uh traffic ads Facebook
Instagram ads are bringing into the platform organic is simply user
initiated as in the user by themselves have come to the WhatsApp number
or the Instagram bot maybe there is a widget on the website of the
customer or somewhere which is redirecting the user but then again it\'s
more it is organic there\'s no money spent on it. Okay so uh let\'s
imagine I mean as the number shows there are 26 people who come to the
start node as in come to the waba number or the Instagram bot over there
or any given channel. They start a conversation that is the total
number. How many people went into which direction which journey what
percentage as you can see over here uh there are there 3.8% of the users
who visited journey 696 and they 100% of that that is one customer
visited the journey and then continue to the next step of the journey
over there. Similarly, if if I want to see other journeys over there. So
this view as in this conversational path shows you nothing but the exact
drop offs which first of all exact bifurcation of users. how many users
are actually uh talking to you in which particular journey and what is
the traffic going further in the next steps. If customers are dropping
off a particular step that means that step has a problem and we need to
fix it. Similarly, there are there\'s a separate dashboard for uh exit
nodes. Let me change this view maybe just a second. Okay, let me change
this. We have changed the project just so that I have some data here.
There\'s some problem with this. I\'m not sure what\'s happening here.
But uh the whole idea of exit nodes is to let users know uh which
particular journey which particular node as in the step of the journey
are the customers dropping off the max. And that helps the brand or the
bot designer or the campaign manager or the functional user for that
sake to go ahead and gauge which uh journey is performing the worst as
in which step is not user friendly which is not a good UX and that helps
toward control that behavior change that journey comparing it comparing
it with the best performing journey over there and replicating the same
for this particular journey. basically helps to go ahead and fine-tune
the bot and also help manage uh less people dropping off for a
particular from a particular step in a particular journey there. And
then comes the most interesting piece which is the AI uh dashboard. It
of course you have different filters over there. I\'m not going to go to
that again but uh it gives you the total number of utterances as in
utter addressances are nothing but the user inputs in three text. uh
then how many were unidentified and how many were identified. Ideally,
this should be reverse as in 34 should be identified and seven should be
unidentified. But this is just a test account. Basically, letting the
administrator know okay your bot bots\'s efficiency is this much. If 100
queries come in, out of that 70 or 85% of them go answered and rest
don\'t go answered and that could that needs rectification. Similarly, I
mean there is a multiple workspace uh concept as you would know to go
ahead and segregate the data and keep it handy for the end agent. So the
journey name, the intent trigger, the number of time it\'s been
triggered, the top journeys or the intents which are performing the best
get listed out here. So that that the admin or the bot designer can
drive insights from it and make the other journeys also better. Okay.
Similarly, I mean there is FAQs. Well, every business needs to go ahead
and answer the queries of the customer and also go ahead and engage with
them in a two-way conversational journey to go ahead and enable services
for them. For example, if I am an ecom brand, I need to answer questions
such as uh what\'s my uh what\'s my return policy? That\'s one. But I
also be need to be able to go ahead and uh let the users order from a
bot platform altogether. So uh the policy answering questions can be
categorized as FAQs and that is what has been shown here. The total
number of questions which came in the answered one the unanswered one
and what were the uh workspaces and the journeys which were consumed the
most. So that\'s pretty much it on the analytics part. Thank you so
much. Uh just in case if you need any help can uh get in touch with me.
Puru is my name, pre-sales is my team. Thank you.
