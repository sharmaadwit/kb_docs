# AA Analytics

## Dashboard Features

## Insight & Detailed Reports

Hi, welcome to a short overview about agent assist analytics. The
analytics section is available on the left hand side under the agent

## Agent Views

assist menu where once you go there will be three key views: dashboards,
insight, and export data. The first one will give you a live monitoring
over what is currently happening within the environment. So how many
ongoing chats? How many bot chats? How many open chats? You know were

## Queue Tags / Team Routing

there any chats did not match a rule? Are there still any that are
waiting for assignment? What is the pending chats which are in pending
status or ones which are awaiting response on the customer's end. You
will be able to see how many agents are logged in, how many busy, how
many offline. We will also be able to go ahead and give an average
weight time or max rate time that is currently there. Time taken to
assign the chats for the current day will also be displayed over here.
That's created by for the current day again would be visible and then we
will be able to also see our average performance metrics in terms of
what was our first response time, what's the average, what is the
maximum in both response time and resolution time as well. Further

## Chat Summary

along, we can see summaries by agent or team level where you will be
able to see how people are performing across the board. And last but not
the least, if you have enabled feedback, you should be able to see how
the feedback ratings have been going as well. The next part would be to
get into insights. Now this is where you have more detailed reports
including chart level metrics where you should be able to go ahead and
see more more details including overall summaries, trends priorities,
FRT summaries, resolution summaries, and response time as well. You can
see over here that we can show overall metrics, first response time
average response time. Again a bit more visual and graphical for you to
be able to take the data in. You can also look at chats created within
business hours versus chats created in non-business hours. Similarly,
there are other reports which include the agent login logout time. So
you'll be able to see how the teams are performing. You know, what are
the login times, dates, and so on. You further can also dig into the
agent chart summary. How many fresh chats were assigned? How many chats
worked upon by the agent? What's the total chats completed? All that
data would be at your fingertips. We can also go back into the dashboard
and if we are looking for some specific charts then in the chart
dashboard itself you can search for a keyword. So we will go ahead and
search for a keyword here. Now in this case and if we update the filter
you can see that I can look at certain time range and we can say okay
I'm looking for data from any time. There are actually two charts. If I
wish to download this, I will be able to select a file name you know
chats with PubShop and we'll be able to go ahead and decide what all
parameters do we wish to export accordingly. Once you do click on export
this data would go into the export option and then we will be able to go
ahead and download it. So here you can see under export data the report
is now ready and we can press the download button. Thank you.
