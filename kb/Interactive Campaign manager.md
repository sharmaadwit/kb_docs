# Interactive Campaign manager

## Transitioning One-Way to Two-Way

## Setting up Quiz Campaigns

## Building Interactive Journeys

Now let's talk about how can we create an interactive campaign which is
converting your one-way campaign into a two-way interaction. To create
an interactive campaign you come onto the campaign manager, click on
broadcast. You can click on new broadcast campaign, and this is where a
toast message will pop up. You can click on interactive and select next.
Let's call it quiz and I'll click on next. Select the audience. In this
case, I'll upload a list. And I'll also check the disclaimer. I've
created a small template which talks about a quiz and if at all somebody
gives the correct answer, they get enrolled into a lucky draw contest.
I'll select this one and I'll click on next. And now the system will
redirect me onto the journey builder wherein I can define the flow that
what if somebody receives this marketing message and they click on the
reply reply button. So the starting node in this case is going to be a
marketing message. This is the template. I'll copy the right answer like
this. And the next node is a wait for event node which actually waits
for a user input. And then I can add a condition over here saying that
if at all somebody replies me back with the right answer. Let's say
we'll ask them for their email like this. Let's also customize this
message a little bit. And once they share me their email, I'll send them
a thank you message. I'll preview this message. If it all everything
looks good, I click on confirm and then I'll send it. Now once the
message is sent, this is how it will look onto WhatsApp. I receive this
template and maybe I'll select the right answer in this case. It's going
to ask me and then I paste my email and now I'm going to receive a thank
which we configured. So this is how you can convert your one-way
marketing campaigns into a two-way interaction.
