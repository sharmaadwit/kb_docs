Welcome to the Gupshup Optimizer, a powerful tool designed to help you
maximize customer engagement through intelligent window-based campaign
optimization. If you want to reach your users at the right time with the
right message, this feature is essential. In this five-minute overview,
the speaker walks through how to leverage user engagement data and send
targeted campaigns based on optimal time windows. Whether you are
managing high-volume customers or want to improve your response rate,
the Optimizer has you covered. One of the most important or powerful
features is the "most engaging hours" visualization, which also has some
window analytics. You can see the total number of users active in the
last hour, as well as average activation in that hour and the "most
engaging hour" data. There is a distributed component with respect to
the most engaging hour data where you are able to see at what time the
number of users is high and when you can actually target them. The rank
one is 12:00 noon, where 711 users are highlighted in bright yellow.
This is your prime time, and the rankings tell you exactly when to
schedule your most important messages and campaigns. If you have a
time-sensitive promotion or announcement, sending it at 12:00 will reach
the most people at their most engaged moment. Even when compared to
12:00, 655 users are available at 1:44. Even though it is just an 8%
decrease, this engagement on a higher scale will result in thousands of
users that are not engaged. This Optimizer makes these insights
transparent so that you can make data-driven scheduling decisions. The
core concept is the window activity charts. The Optimizer analyzes when
your users are most active during a 24-hour period. On the left, you
will see a visual breakdown of user distribution by time windows
displayed in a pie chart showing user engagement segments across four
different time slots, such as 0 to 6 hours, 6 to 12 hours, 12 to 18
hours, etc.. There is also a detailed bar chart that talks about the
number of users over each hour, which showcases how many users are
active at what hour of the campaign that is being sent out. These
metrics are gold for campaign timing optimizations. The speaker explains
what exactly the Optimizer does, including user distribution by time
window. The detailed count can be a downloadable report where you can
export all the phone numbers, etc.. Executing these campaigns happens in
the campaign tab. There are two different ways in which this can be
handled. One is immediate campaigns, where you can send messages right
now to targeted users, or you can schedule the campaign by setting up a
recurring or future-dated campaign. For immediate campaigns, you will
provide details like a campaign ID, which is optional. If you do not
have a campaign ID, a unique ID will be automatically generated. You can
choose between a free text message that you can send and a utility
template. Since they are not sending a marketing campaign, the 24-hour
window targeting will happen automatically from a free text message that
is coming on the Gupshup site. You can enter your text message, and then
you can have a target window for all the users that are there. Targeting
is done by specifying at what hour how many users were active and
sending the text message to those users to engage them better. The
speaker selects the hours they want the users to be targeted; these are
the peak hours that are highlighted in green. You can also add some test
numbers here to test it out and then send the campaigns, which will
reach all the users who are in the hour bracket that is listed down. You
can also see the campaign history based on different campaigns that have
been executed, as well as different entries that show all the campaign
names, which can be a downloaded report as well. The Optimizer has a
tracking capability where all the different file details or identifiers
are available, and each row represents a completed or in-progress
campaign. This actually serves multiple things: you can maintain a
complete audit trail of all the campaigns that are sent, analyze the
templates and times across different performances, and learn what worked
to adjust future campaigns accordingly. In the environment with active
campaigns, you see metrics like delivery rate, engagement rate, and
response rate per campaign, allowing you to continuously refine your
message strategy as well. That is all about the Optimizer.
