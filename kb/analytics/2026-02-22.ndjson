So if you see here in the event,\nwhatever new events you are creating will get listed here and that can\nsubsequently be mapped across the profiles in the personalized layer.\nYeah. For more details as I said, if you go to the integration section,\nyou\\'ll get to see detailed documentation available which can help you\nto understand in more detail about how this integration works. I hope\nthis was helpful. Thank you so much.\n\n---\n\n## Custom Webhook Setup\n\n---\n\n## Custom Profile Properties\nHi there. This is a quick demo of Gupshop\\'s Personalize module. So\nwhenever we want to navigate to our customer data, we can click on\nPersonalize, and there are three, in fact, four tabs. In the Guide\nsection, you can get a quick access to the official documentations,\nwherein the document can help you guide on how to create lists,\nsegments, how to create new profile properties, and what is the overall\nuse of profiles. In the All Profile section, you can have a bird\\'s eye\nview of your complete database. You can have a look on your profiles.\nYou can also have a look on the total number of profiles, how many are\nactive on a monthly basis, and what is the total number of mobile\nnumbers available. Similar information in a graphical manner, and a few\nshortcuts of other modules that are present. So you can access Campaign\nManager, you can access Bot Studio, you can access Integrations, and\nalso click to WhatsApp ads. And again, a list of all the users that are\ncurrently there on the console. So if at all I click on any one of these\nusers, for example, I can get two types of information. Number one, I\ncan get their information or also see what lists and segments are they a\npart of. I can also see their profile properties as well. I can quickly\nupdate it, delete it, or in fact, add new information as well. Some\nsystem-generated information, wherein when was this profile created,\nwhen was it last active, and all of that, and all the console events\nthat will be present on the right-hand side. So this is the Events\nTimeline, wherein you can see all the events that the person is\nperforming. So let\\'s say if they have received a campaign, you will be\nable to see that event. You can see whether the message was delivered to\nthem or not, whether did they read it or not, if at all the user\\'s read\nevents are on. You can also see if at all they clicked on any button or\nnot. In fact, you can also see if at all there is any third-party\nintegration through which any events are coming from any external system\nlike CleverTap, MoEngage, or even the website directly. You can also\nhave a bird\\'s eye view of those events as well. So events like sign-up,\nproduct purchase, page browse, page load, and all of those events can\nalso become a part of this Events Timeline. The second tab is Lists and\nSegments, wherein you can do two things. Either you can import and\nexport data onto the Gupshup console by simply clicking on \\\"Create a\nnew list\\\". Give it some name, create. You can also download a sample\nfile to match the format. And if at all you have the file ready in the\nrequired format, you can simply browse it and simply select it. Click on\n\\\"Save,\\\" and then the list will get updated in a few minutes with all\nthe data in the list. The second thing is", "latency_ms": 1636}
