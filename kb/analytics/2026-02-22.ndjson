So if you see here in the event,\nwhatever new events you are creating will get listed here and that can\nsubsequently be mapped across the profiles in the personalized layer.\nYeah. For more details as I said, if you go to the integration section,\nyou\\'ll get to see detailed documentation available which can help you\nto understand in more detail about how this integration works. I hope\nthis was helpful. Thank you so much.\n\n---\n\n## Custom Webhook Setup\n\n---\n\n## Custom Profile Properties\nHi there. This is a quick demo of Gupshop\\'s Personalize module. So\nwhenever we want to navigate to our customer data, we can click on\nPersonalize, and there are three, in fact, four tabs. In the Guide\nsection, you can get a quick access to the official documentations,\nwherein the document can help you guide on how to create lists,\nsegments, how to create new profile properties, and what is the overall\nuse of profiles. In the All Profile section, you can have a bird\\'s eye\nview of your complete database. You can have a look on your profiles.\nYou can also have a look on the total number of profiles, how many are\nactive on a monthly basis, and what is the total number of mobile\nnumbers available. Similar information in a graphical manner, and a few\nshortcuts of other modules that are present. So you can access Campaign\nManager, you can access Bot Studio, you can access Integrations, and\nalso click to WhatsApp ads. And again, a list of all the users that are\ncurrently there on the console. So if at all I click on any one of these\nusers, for example, I can get two types of information. Number one, I\ncan get their information or also see what lists and segments are they a\npart of. I can also see their profile properties as well. I can quickly\nupdate it, delete it, or in fact, add new information as well. Some\nsystem-generated information, wherein when was this profile created,\nwhen was it last active, and all of that, and all the console events\nthat will be present on the right-hand side. So this is the Events\nTimeline, wherein you can see all the events that the person is\nperforming. So let\\'s say if they have received a campaign, you will be\nable to see that event. You can see whether the message was delivered to\nthem or not, whether did they read it or not, if at all the user\\'s read\nevents are on. You can also see if at all they clicked on any button or\nnot. In fact, you can also see if at all there is any third-party\nintegration through which any events are coming from any external system\nlike CleverTap, MoEngage, or even the website directly. You can also\nhave a bird\\'s eye view of those events as well. So events like sign-up,\nproduct purchase, page browse, page load, and all of those events can\nalso become a part of this Events Timeline. The second tab is Lists and\nSegments, wherein you can do two things. Either you can import and\nexport data onto the Gupshup console by simply clicking on \\\"Create a\nnew list\\\". Give it some name, create. You can also download a sample\nfile to match the format. And if at all you have the file ready in the\nrequired format, you can simply browse it and simply select it. Click on\n\\\"Save,\\\" and then the list will get updated in a few minutes with all\nthe data in the list. The second thing is", "latency_ms": 1636}

Once the template is created, it will be added under\nthe bot, and from there we can directly trigger the campaign. In case\nyou want to test, right, you can have a test device added over here by\nsimply adding the number. Right. And once it is there, you can simply,\nyou know, send a single text or sorry, RCS message to the customer.\nRight? Now if you want to run a campaign, so we can simply go to the\ncampaign section, add new campaign. You can select the bot whatever you\nhave created. I'll just select the promotional and the template under\nit. Right. Once you are fine with the bot and template, we can schedule\nthe campaign. Right now it gives us the liberty and flexibility to\nselect between different time zones and select with the exact timeline.\nIf we select run later, it gives us to, you know, option to select the\ndate, the campaign hours, seconds, minutes, AM, and PM. So we can\ncustomize this. And once we click on submit, the campaign will be\nscheduled. Right?\n\n---\n\n# Automated Campaign manager\n\n---\n\n## Managing Campaigns\nStarting off with the Campaign Manager, under which there are two\nmodules. Broadcast allows you to reach out to your user base using a\nWhatsApp template. So in four simple steps you can reach out to an\naudience by broadcasting a WhatsApp message. There are simple four steps\nwhere in you\\'ll give the broadcaster a name, you select a list of\naudience, you select a pre-approved template and then you schedule the\nmessage for a specific time. If at all I click on new broadcast\ncampaign, we also have an option for interactive, which is like a step\nup from your regular way of doing it, which is one way. In the\ninteractive campaigns, you can send out a WhatsApp message and connect\nit to a conversation on WhatsApp. So let\\'s say if there\\'s any WhatsApp\ncampaign with a quick reply button and if a user clicks on that button,\ninstead of just noting that value, you can also trigger a small bot\njourney and a person can click on any reply button and then start\ntalking to a bot which can lead to increased engagement. The idea is to\nconvert a one-way campaign into a two-way interaction.\n\nAutomated campaigns allows you to control all the messages that need to\ngo out in an automated manner. It is majorly used to support use cases\nlike payment reminders, appointment reminders, payment dues and all of\nthat. Where in you can click on new automated campaign, you can give it\na name, check the disclaimer. And this is where in you can select it on\nthe basis of a date property, simply select the date and you can define\nwhen should the campaign start. Let\\'s say I say on the date property at\nwhat time and whether should it repeat or not. So all the messages that\nneed to be triggered automatically can be handled using automated\ncampaigns.\n\nAny message that needs to go out to a large number of users, that\nmessage needs to be templatized. This is a policy by Meta. So the\ntemplate section is where in you can build different types of templates.\nIf at all I click on create new template, this window pops up where in\nthere are three types of categories: marketing, utility and\nauthentication. Authentication is used to cover OTPs, utilities are used\nto send out all the service implicit messages when you\\'re trying to\ngive updates regarding a service to a person, like hey your order was\ndelivered, your payment failed, your payment was completed, something\nlike that. And marketing messages are the ones where in you\\'re trying\nto promote any product or any service. There are different types of\nmarketing templates as well. You can always send out a custom message,\nyou can send out product messages where in up to 30 products can be\nlisted out in a single template and there\\'s an add to cart button as\nwell on the WhatsApp template. You can also send out carousels where i\n\n---\n\n## Performance Analytics & Tracking Reports\nNow, let us understand how do you send out a WhatsApp campaign. To do a\nWhatsApp campaign, you click on Campaign Manager and select broadcast.\nThis is where you can see all of your existing campaigns in such a\nmanner. You can also filter them based on sent, drafts, expired,\nscheduled, et cetera. For example, I click on \"all\". I can click on \"new\nbroadcast campaign\". The toast message pops up. I can select \"one way\"\nin this case and I'll select \"next\". Now I'll give it a name. Let's call\nit \"campaign demo\". The next step is to select an audience. Either you\ncan upload a list or a segment that exists on the platform's\npersonalization section. You can send it to all the users as well, or\nyou can also upload a list. There's an option which says \"download\nsample\". And this is what a sample file looks like. Over here you can\nsee the first column is phone number, which is mandatory, and the\nsubsequent fields can be added for further personalization. In this\ncase, I have added customer name and a link because I'm also going to be\ncovering how dynamic link tracking is done. I'll close this file. In the\nupload test section, I'll click on \"choose file\". But before that, I'll\nalso enable link tracking. And now I'll upload my file like this. Once\nthat is done, you get a success message and the total number of rows\nthat exist in the file. I'll also check this disclaimer. The next step\nis to select a template. In this case, let's say I'll select this \"copy\none time offer\" template. I'll select this. The fourth step is to\npreview the campaign, where you set up the template. First of all, offer\nexpiry. Let's say I'll add a fallback value over here, which is going to\nbe, \"when should the offer expire?\". I'll say 14th, maybe. And then what\nshould be the button value? Again, I'll select a fallback value like\nthis. And over here, I'll say this is an offer for 50% off. So I'll say\n\"50 off\". On the next step, this is the last step where you can preview\nthe campaign to see whether everything looks good or not. And if\neverything is fine, you can either send it now, schedule it for later by\nselecting a date and time. And then we also have an option of a\nrecurring campaign. If at all it's a campaign that's meant to be sent at\nmultiple days of the week, you can actually repeat it at a specific\ntime. So let's say I'll say 3 days, it ends never, and today's going\nthis is going to be the start date, and in this case, it will repeat\nevery 3 days. I'll close this and I can send it now, and within the next\n2 minutes, your WhatsApp message will be sent to the complete list. Now,\nonce a WhatsApp message is sent, you can actually see the analytics of\nit. So for every WhatsApp message that's sent, you can simply simply\nfilter out all the sent c", "latency_ms": 1485}
