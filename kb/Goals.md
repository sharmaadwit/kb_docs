# Goals

## Goal Implementation in Journeys

Hi there and welcome to webshop academy, today we will be talking about
something that can help us create custom reports and track user
engagement at any point of the journey. That is we will talk about goal
nodes. So whenever goal nodes is something that resides in bot studios
section over here in goal nodes and once you make a goal this can be
then utilized in journeys.

So let\'s look at an example how goals are made and then how they can be
input in the journeys. So just right now I have created one goal named
as goal demonstration. So you can click create goals by clicking on
create a goal I have already created one so I\'ll click on edit as soon
as I do that there is a name that has been given to it goal
demonstration wherein I\'ll be showcasing a simple use case where I\'m
going to select a user city and their preferred date.

## Defining Milestones & Trackers

You can collect any kind of information and then store it on the
console. So let\'s so this is just a very simple example. This is the
goal name and its description and then we have milestones.

So every a goal could be anything right a product purchase could be a
goal but for that product purchase to happen a person has to complete a
few steps. So those steps are referred to as milestones. So in my
milestone one I just renamed it as preferences because in these in this
milestone I\'ll be having two trackers I\'ll be collecting a person\'s
city and their date.

In default value I have input 0 as a default and then I have clicked on
save. So now I can go back and in now I can come out to my board studios
journey builder. Click on create a journey but I already have one
journey simple journey created wherein I have set this as the trigger
word and I am just asking myself two questions.

What is my city and what\'s my date. And after this I have a goal node
so I delete this particular goal node and in my last node I\'ll say
I\'ll select the goal that I just created which is goal demonstration.
In this I\'ll select the milestone which is preferences.

Now all these responses I\'m storing momentarily in a variable demo var
and again this again a similar momentary variable whose name is demo
underscore var. So once I have this goal node which of course I can
click by navigating over here. Just a second toggle this off and then
this.

Now in my action nodes we have a goal node from this. So there\'s one
already over here. So I\'ll select the goal I\'ll select the milestone
name and in the tracker values.

So city I was storing in a variable called demo underscore var. So in
city I\'ll recall this particular variable. So whenever a user enters
their input value then that can be called in such a manner.

And then the second which is the city the date I\'m storing it in var
demo. I\'ll do this. I\'ll store it in this particular variable for now
date then I can come over here and recall this variable in such a
manner.

Now our journey has been made and then let\'s customize this message a
little. So I\'ll now click on save and deploy. Now this journey has been
deployed.

We\'ll wait for hardly 10 to 15 seconds. Now I can come out to WhatsApp
and maybe try and trigger this particular journey. So maybe I\'ll say
goal demo.

I get asked the question I\'ll say Delhi. And then I\'ll prefer a
preferred date 2nd April. So now I\'ve gotten the greeting message.

So now I can come back to my journeys. Maybe I\'ll click on goals. I can
click on analytics.

## Goal Analytics & Export

So the total number of goals achieved in this particular time frame and
unique users count is over here. Now if at all I scroll down I can also
export this. So if at all I export this.

I can click on export. Now I\'ll download this particular CSV. So now
we\'ll see how systematically all the data that we have been collecting
that can be looked at.

So this is the tracker. If at all I click on enable editing. This is the
trends and then in preferences I can also see the values that occur.

This is the serial number. This is the timestamp of my input. This is
the channel.

This is my customer ID. So these are the few default fields that come
with the exportation. Now all my tracker values which is the city and
the date.

These are the ones that I just input and my source is organic since I
initiated the user journey and in the source value. So this is how you
can utilize goal nodes. These can be.

These can be put in journeys to track where users are dropping off or
which all milestones have a has which phone number completed number one.
And this can also be used to store customer values or preferences in
such a manner. So any use cases wherein you\'re trying to get a form
filled by users or something like that.

This is how it can be done on the console without any integration. So
yeah, that\'s it. And thanks for watching.
