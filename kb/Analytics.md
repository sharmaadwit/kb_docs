Welcome to this quick tour of the Gupshup conversation cloud analytics
dashboard. Whether you're managing WhatsApp campaigns, tracking customer
engagement, or monitoring message performance, this powerful analytics
hub gives you all the insights you need at a glance. In the next five
minutes, we'll go through the key features and show you how to leverage
them for better camping performance. This is your command center for
understanding camping performance. Right, the dashboard is organized
into clear tabs for different data views. Currently, we are on the
WhatsApp analytics dashboard which will give you overview insights with
respect to how your WhatsApp campaigns have performed. what exactly is
happening etc. And we also have the monthly active user dashboard that
you can utilize for better understanding of your monthly active users.
Now this dashboard also has customization features. At the top of the
dashboard you'll find powerful filtering options. The first control is
the date range calculator uh which is set for filtering for a particular
period of time and also we have the account number filteration. So let's
say if you are using multiple WhatsApp account or client accounts you'll
be able to filter it better and understand the in analytics and insights
for this as well. The third uh filtering option that we have here is by
template name. We can just type in a template name and add that as a
filter for analyzing how the template performance has been so far. Below
this we have the me message level summary. The message level summary
talks about the different kinds of features for campaign optimization.
Uh which talks about reasons for message failures. uh which talks about
how many messages have been sent, requested submitted, delivered etc. We
also have a graphical representation of this particular count where it
can also be classified and filtered by template names where you can see
at on what date was the failure rate higher or the message send rate
higher. um at on what days were the delivery rates higher and based on
different uh templates the metrics will change accordingly. We also have
the per message pricing. So based on different bifurcations that are
available whether it is marketing utility service uh all the messages
bifocation how many are submitted requested are available. On top of
this uh we also have the gupshuck pricing which is um the advanced
standard and total message count that is there and how many are coming
from which module how many are responded by the agent. How many are
structured journeys and all the counts are available directly here and
if there are AI messages being used the AI component also is populated
here. This gives you a complete breakdown of exactly the kind of
performance that is there for the analytics dashboard. We also have a
template level summary available uh which showcases exactly the kind of
error codes that you might receive uh for the message failure details as
well as what kind of user engagement have you seen so far and it what
hour of the day is the user engagement higher uh and which geographical
region these customers are coming from and when are these messages read
by the day of the week. These are some of the metrics that we are
available on the analytics dashboard for WhatsApp analytics. We also
have a count on the monthly active users tab. This tab ideally shows uh
in the month of course it has a date filter and in the month how many
active users are present and what kind of sessions have happened so far.
Apart from this, the analytics dashboard also has a report section where
you have the delivery rate report as well as campaign analytics that are
available. Uh so the delivery report ideally you can just select the
date and time range and then generate the report which can be then
downloaded from here in the form of a CSV file. And we also have the
campaign analytics after selecting the date um for aggregated campaign
report or we just want to know about the link clicks that has happened
so far or we have the button clicks that have happened. All these things
are still available for the environment and for the business to analyze.
So this will give you a file which can then be downloaded at the compass
zip which contains all these different components whether it's read
rates total clicks unique clicks CTRs etc. Uh that's about the analytics
dashboard that is there at Gupshup.
