Now, let us understand how do you send out a WhatsApp campaign. To do a
WhatsApp campaign, you click on Campaign Manager and select broadcast.
This is where you can see all of your existing campaigns in such a
manner. You can also filter them based on sent, drafts, expired,
scheduled, et cetera. For example, I click on "all". I can click on "new
broadcast campaign". The toast message pops up. I can select "one way"
in this case and I'll select "next". Now I'll give it a name. Let's call
it "campaign demo". The next step is to select an audience. Either you
can upload a list or a segment that exists on the platform's
personalization section. You can send it to all the users as well, or
you can also upload a list. There's an option which says "download
sample". And this is what a sample file looks like. Over here you can
see the first column is phone number, which is mandatory, and the
subsequent fields can be added for further personalization. In this
case, I have added customer name and a link because I'm also going to be
covering how dynamic link tracking is done. I'll close this file. In the
upload test section, I'll click on "choose file". But before that, I'll
also enable link tracking. And now I'll upload my file like this. Once
that is done, you get a success message and the total number of rows
that exist in the file. I'll also check this disclaimer. The next step
is to select a template. In this case, let's say I'll select this "copy
one time offer" template. I'll select this. The fourth step is to
preview the campaign, where you set up the template. First of all, offer
expiry. Let's say I'll add a fallback value over here, which is going to
be, "when should the offer expire?". I'll say 14th, maybe. And then what
should be the button value? Again, I'll select a fallback value like
this. And over here, I'll say this is an offer for 50% off. So I'll say
"50 off". On the next step, this is the last step where you can preview
the campaign to see whether everything looks good or not. And if
everything is fine, you can either send it now, schedule it for later by
selecting a date and time. And then we also have an option of a
recurring campaign. If at all it's a campaign that's meant to be sent at
multiple days of the week, you can actually repeat it at a specific
time. So let's say I'll say 3 days, it ends never, and today's going
this is going to be the start date, and in this case, it will repeat
every 3 days. I'll close this and I can send it now, and within the next
2 minutes, your WhatsApp message will be sent to the complete list. Now,
once a WhatsApp message is sent, you can actually see the analytics of
it. So for every WhatsApp message that's sent, you can simply simply
filter out all the sent campaigns like this. And in this case, let's say
this is one of the campaigns that I sent earlier. I can click on this,
and this is how the analytics look like. So if at all there's a button
in the template, it also shows the click analysis. It also shows how
many users were targeted, whether the message was submitted on Meta or
not. Was it directly sent to the end user, and was it finally delivered
to the user or not? Click analysis: how many clicks were made? How many
number of unique clicks? And if at all I scroll down, there are two
parameters over here. One is the response file, and one is the link
tracking report. So I can click on "response file," and the system will
download this file for me, which I can open. This is where you can see
whether the message was sent or not. In case it was failed, it also
shows the reason of failure like this. So there are multiple fields
which says accordingly. Campaign ID, the phone numbers, the channel on
which you reach out to the customer, what was the template name, whether
the validation was success or not. And then you can also see failure
reason in case of failure of delivery, and the delivery status in this
case was delivered. When was it delivered? And all the time stamps will
be available over here. I can close this and I can also see the this uh
link tracking report of this campaign as well. Say, for example, I click
on this "link tracking report". Again, the system downloads it for me. I
click on this. This is where you can see whether the person clicked onto
the link or not. And you can also see the time stamp. So again, the
campaign ID, the original URL, which was there in the sheet, which was
there in this particular excel. Gap URL, the phone number which clicked
on the uh which clicked on the URL or not. What browser was it, what was
the IP, what was the device, and ultimately the click time stamp. So
this is how you can do a WhatsApp broadcast campaign and how you can
track the analytics of the campaign and track how many people received
the message, how many people clicked on any buttons if there were any,
and how, at what time did they interact with the message.
