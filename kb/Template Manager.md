# Template Manager

Hi everyone, in today\'s episode we are going to talk about templates.
As we all know if any customer wants to send out broadcast messages to
their customers, the first step for them is to get the content approved
by Meta. Now this applies for all the category of messages, whether
it\'s a marketing, utility, authentication.

## Template Library (Verticals)

Now let\'s see how seamlessly Gupshub template dashboard helps you to
create templates and do other stuff as well. Now over here, before we
get started, there are three tabs to start with. There is something
called template library.

As you can see, this is Gupshub template library created and maintained
by Gupshub. And we have templates for different verticals over here. For
example, if you want to and if you are an e-com company, you will get to
see that the starting templates are already pre-created in the system.

You can always go and use these templates as it is. For example, if you
want to just personalize this a little bit more for your brand, you have
the ready to use content already available. You simply can actually edit
the content and then you can send it for approval.

So it\'s a very easy to use, I would say canvas, wherein whatever
configuration you want to do, whatever content you want to change, you
can simply do it. And at the end of this, you can preview and submit.
While you are doing any of this, you\'ll also be able to see a quick
snapshot of how the message will look like when it lands to your
customer phone.

So this is about some pre-approved library, which Gupshub maintains. And
we keep on updating that so that as and when if you want to use any of
these, you\'re good to go. When we go to pre-approved templates, now
these are purely approved or I would say rather pre-approved templates
by Meta.

Majorly these comes under the category of utility. Anything which is
marketing, you have to always create from scratch and get it approved by
Meta. But some basic delivery appointment related templates, pre-created
templates, especially for e-commerce and financials are already there
available here.

If you want to start using these templates, you can simply use it or you
can make any content changes. Ensure that if whenever you are doing any
content changes, it will always be resubmitted to Meta and subject to
Meta\'s approval only, you will be able to broadcast this to your
audiences. Now let\'s see and see how we can create a template from
scratch.

You will see that over here on the right, there is a button called plus
create template. Once you\'ll create on, you will land to our canvas
here, where you can start building the template from scratch. Whatever
fields are mandatory, these are marked.

And if you do not fill those information, you will not be able to move
to the next steps. While you build your template, you will be able to
see the preview of the template happening in the right hand side.
Category is important.

So whatever content you are planning to send to your customers, you have
to always choose the right category. Meta also subjects the right to
change the content category or sorry, template category based on the
content you have provided. So if you\'re trying to get a utility, sorry,
marketing template get approved in the utility.

You will get to see that there is an option wherein if you opt in that
if the content falls in the linear category, Meta has an access to
change that and then update or approve that template under some other
category also. So here, the all the newly supported template types are
all available, whether it\'s about custom message, product message,
carousels, LTO. So whatever the newly launched templates are there by
Meta, you will get to see all of that already incorporated in a
platform.

Simply select the category, choose the language you want to send, give a
template label. This is important. So it is basically to review Meta
what kind of template you are going to send to customer.

If there is any promotional marketing message, ensure that you define it
here saying that marketing, promotional, all those keywords. You know
that Meta allows you to send out what you can send actually rich media
templates on WhatsApp. So whether it\'s a text image, video document
location, you simply can choose a header.

And let\'s say if you choose an image as a header, at this point of
time, it\'s important for you to provide the sample media file also. So
needless, not needless if the file is going to be the same when you do
the real campaign or not. But at the moment, you have to actually upload
a sample file.

Same goes to body while you are creating a template, you always have an
option to add multiple variables. For example, if you want to
personalize for customer name, right, you already have a database where
you have name of the customers, you can create templates with some
variable fields so that at the runtime when you are running the
campaign, you always can map these fields with the right attributes. In
case if you don\'t have any of the attributes or any of the details
available at the runtime, it will still you will still be able to use a
template by defining a default value.

For example, for those customers whose names are not there in your
database, you can simply define a callback as customer. And to those
whose names are already there, it will get get mapped and go to them
like that.

## Content Formatting & Media

To ensure that the template you\'re creating has, you know,
looks the look and feel of the template, the content you share is very
aesthetic, you will have the features here like making the statement as
bold, italic, strikethrough, you also have bullet points and number
options available.

And whatever total maximum char limit you can write a template for, you
will get to see it here. So if you you see that if you try to write
something and it is extending beyond the template character count, it
will give you an error here itself. Same goes to footer, whatever
component are optional means optional.

But in case if you want to give any disclaimer to the customer, opt out,
whether it\'s for stop unsubscribe, or let\'s say to perform any actions
that press yes to move forward, you may simply define that and the
footer itself. And this is how it is going to look like on the template
here. Moving forward, you have two sort of buttons here.

## Dynamic Variables & CTAs

Generally, at any at any template, the maximum button which is allowed
is three, you can have a combination of quick reply and CTA. Quick reply
basically helps customer to or maybe whatever response you want to
collect from the customer. As a user response, you can use quick reply.

And CTAs are used when you want to redirect the customer to a specific
URL, phone number, or let\'s say if you want to give any offer code,
when clicking on a button, a particular offer code can be copied. Within
the URL itself, we have two options again, if whether that, you know,
URL can be static, which means one same URL can be will be gone to all
the broadcast list you are sharing, or the or the URL can also be
dynamic, you can define the dynamic URL and while you are sending the
campaign at the runtime, you can map the variable here. And you also
have an option to track that.

So in case if you want to see that who has clicked on that CTA, you can
actually choose the option dynamic link with tracking. Now at the end of
this, you can see that you will get to see preview and submit. Once you
click on preview and submit in case if those fields are not selected or
mapped, it will not let you to go forward.

And once you finish all the steps, you will be able to go forward and
submit the template. So yeah, this is how typically you do that. And
once you submit the template, you will come back to the home screen
automatically.

And it will show you that the template is in a submitted status. The
moment you know the template gets approved, it will automatically get
approved here. And let\'s say if any template is rejected, it will
appear to you like this.

While if a template is rejected, you still can resubmit the template by
not starting from the scratch. But what you can do is that you can
simply go here and click on edit template. By default, any of the
template which is rejected or approved can be edited two times.

But you can always create a clone of the template and create a new
template ID. If you edit the template, the template ID remains the same.
But if you clone the template, new template ID is created.

In case if you want to know why the template was rejected, you can
simply click here. And you\'ll get to see the reason of rejection also.
So whatever the reason the template was rejected for whether it\'s an
incorrect category, or any specific reason meta will meta will give that
error code as well and details as well and you will be able to track it
here as well.

So by when you want to reedit the template, you will be having you will
be able to do that according to the error codes. So this is how you can
track it. But over here you will see that we have also kind of created a
very elastic search option so that let\'s say if you want to search any
template by name, you simply can put the keywords and basis the keyword
you will be able to find the templates.

## Approval Tracking & Search

Not that if you have the template ID handy or less specific content,
let\'s say in the template at any given point if you had mentioned cars,
you will be able to track by the content also. So all of the search is
possible. You\'ll also have some other sort options wherein you can sort
the template or name last updated and created on.

And then you can actually let\'s say if you want to change this filter
from ascending to descending, you can do that. Here you can see that
there are broader categories wise if you want to segregate your
templates, you can do that. Whether it\'s some you want to see the
templates which are approved, rejected, submitted, paused.

Sometimes what happens is that when you\'re running a campaign and if
any sort of spam happens or if MetaPost pauses your template, any
particular template, you will get to see those templates listed here.
And same goes to fail deactivated and all of these templates. Apart from
that, you also have a very detailed filter option here.

So apart from searching the template here, you also can kind of narrow
down your search here, wherein it starts with the account level. And on
top of it, you can choose a template category. For example, at this
point of time, we want to see what other marketing templates are
available.

And on that as well, you have an option of selecting the template type.
For example, you want to see that what whichever marketing template had
a video message attached to it, you simply can click here. Quality wise.

Yes, we do have quality rating also. So if you see here on right hand
side, any template when it\'s approved, it is at not rated stage, right.
But the moment you start publishing this to a larger set of audience
basis, the interaction on basis, the template performance meta will
generate your template.

So if the template engagement is high, you will get to see the status as
high, medium or low. And hence you\'ll also be able to say segregate or
categorize or filter the template basis these ratings. For example, I
want to see which are the template which has an average rating, we can
click here, last updated.

Let\'s say if you want to see what are the templates which are last
updated in seven days. And last is language. So if you we have a quite a
bit detailed search or filter option available.

And if you want to filter your template through all of these categories,
you can do that. So that\'s all about templates today. Thank you so
much.
