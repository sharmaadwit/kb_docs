Hello, everyone. In today's session, we'll be getting a glimpse of the
agent assist settings section. The agent assist comes with a range of
powerful settings that can help businesses manage their customer support
needs effectively and efficiently. In order to master the agent assist
and utilize the maximum efficiency of this particular offering that we
have, there is an overview dashboard that is provided for project owners
and admins. To start off with the basics of agent assist, which includes

## Queue Tags / Team Routing

how to build a team, how to have a user management configuration done,
how do we navigate chats in an efficient manner, what kind of metrics
and dashboards do we provide to the customers, and how do you increase
or maintain your team's performance by analyzing this dashboard as well
as setting up certain router appliance for increasing the efficiency of
your agents. There are major configurations that are also present on an
overview. So based on the business goals and requirements, we can
configure these as well in a very quick fashion. Now, towards the left
hand side, we have the rest of the components which includes assignment
rules, chat rules, agent status, scan responses, views, chat fields,
feedback forms, etc., which are gathered into separate modules over here
for better understanding and analysis and setups. Now, with the user
management module, we'll be able to invite the users, edit and delete
users, add users, etc., based on the new passwords and everything. So we
can add those users which are created to a particular team based on a
region, based on time zones, based on subject matter expertise, etc..
Any kind of agent status that is required, for example, if a person is
available right now, unavailable, busy, etc., can be configured, and you
can create---these are some of the system default ones---but you can
also create a new status request according to your requirements.
Automations work efficiently with respect to the agent assist
environment. So, how does with assignment rules, businesses can specify
conditions for assigning chats to agents in a particular fashion. With
chat rules, can be used to prioritize and tag incoming chats. Any kind
of auto replies that needs to be configured or feedback that needs to be
provided from the customer's side, etc., can also be configured directly
on the environment. So there are multiple different options that are
available which will benefit the process of how the automation can be
done and how efficiently the tags can be managed. We've also introduced
journey triggers. So from a particular agent side, we can trigger an
entire journey if that configuration is available. Next, we have
productivity tools wherein we are able to manage the different view

## Agent Views

options that are there which helps agents to access chats of a specific
category in a dedicated bucket.

## User Details Panel

We also have chat fields which are
configurable which can be used to store qualitative data about these
chats. It can be with respect to information about the customer that can
be useful in providing a resolution in a faster way. We also have SLAs
which are used to set targets for agents and improve productivity of the
agents where you can have different combination of notifications,
triggers, metrics, etc., that can be configured. The feedback forms that
we have allow businesses to collect valuable feedback from the
customers. So we have gone through the entire workflows and automation
part of that. We have recently introduced the AI management module where

## Rewrite/Expand/Rephrase

the customer---the agent---has an option to rephrase the text that they
have,

## Chat Summary

expand and summarize it according to the requirements, and the
co-pilot option also helps in sending suggested responses and generating
responses, etc. The account manager configurations ideally helps with
creating authenticated environments. If we have to enable SSO for all
our agents or login IDs for two-step authentication, etc.. Webhooks for
specific events that can be triggered where chat can be triggered, any
kind of API configurations that needs to be done to push information
into a particular environment. We have all the password policies that
can be set up as well. So how do we manage all these accounts, which
channel have been hosted this on, etc., can be configured from the
account settings page. So with these powerful settings, businesses can
now streamline their entire process, whether it is customer support,
sales, etc., and provide quick and efficient support to their customers.
So that's for the session. Thank you so much.
