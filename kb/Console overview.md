# Console overview

Hi there. This is a quick overview of the Gupshup console and its
capabilities. Gupshup is a tool which can help businesses with their
operations throughout the customer life cycle, whether it\'s lead
generation, whether it\'s a customer in the funnel and you\'re trying to
assist them to convert them, or whether it\'s an already existing
customer and you\'re trying to support them. Gupshup can help you
throughout the customer life cycle. And we have all the right tools
which are all mentioned on the left, which can be accessed from this
tab, which can help you support these operations.

## Platform Navigation

Starting off with the home page, where in you can see your WhatsApp
number, you can see the status, whether it\'s verified and live. You can
also see your ability to send messages, you can see the messaging limit,
you can see your quality rating, which basically tells about your
WhatsApp business health and how people are engaging with your messages.
You can see whether there are any template restrictions or not and how
many messages can go out within a second, allowed throughput. A few
numbers related to campaigns and automated campaigns, how many campaigns
are being done, what is the total number of messages that are being sent
and a shortcut to these modules as well. Personalize where in you can
see an overview of your customer data, how many total profiles are
there, how many total customers are there and how many of them are
active. And you can also see a bird\'s eye view of the total number of
conversations and how many messages are being exchanged in these
conversations. And a few more shortcuts of all the remaining modules
mentioned on the left.

## Managing Campaigns

Starting off with the Campaign Manager, under which there are two
modules. Broadcast allows you to reach out to your user base using a
WhatsApp template. So in four simple steps you can reach out to an
audience by broadcasting a WhatsApp message. There are simple four steps
where in you\'ll give the broadcaster a name, you select a list of
audience, you select a pre-approved template and then you schedule the
message for a specific time. If at all I click on new broadcast
campaign, we also have an option for interactive, which is like a step
up from your regular way of doing it, which is one way. In the
interactive campaigns, you can send out a WhatsApp message and connect
it to a conversation on WhatsApp. So let\'s say if there\'s any WhatsApp
campaign with a quick reply button and if a user clicks on that button,
instead of just noting that value, you can also trigger a small bot
journey and a person can click on any reply button and then start
talking to a bot which can lead to increased engagement. The idea is to
convert a one-way campaign into a two-way interaction.

Automated campaigns allows you to control all the messages that need to
go out in an automated manner. It is majorly used to support use cases
like payment reminders, appointment reminders, payment dues and all of
that. Where in you can click on new automated campaign, you can give it
a name, check the disclaimer. And this is where in you can select it on
the basis of a date property, simply select the date and you can define
when should the campaign start. Let\'s say I say on the date property at
what time and whether should it repeat or not. So all the messages that
need to be triggered automatically can be handled using automated
campaigns.

Any message that needs to go out to a large number of users, that
message needs to be templatized. This is a policy by Meta. So the
template section is where in you can build different types of templates.
If at all I click on create new template, this window pops up where in
there are three types of categories: marketing, utility and
authentication. Authentication is used to cover OTPs, utilities are used
to send out all the service implicit messages when you\'re trying to
give updates regarding a service to a person, like hey your order was
delivered, your payment failed, your payment was completed, something
like that. And marketing messages are the ones where in you\'re trying
to promote any product or any service. There are different types of
marketing templates as well. You can always send out a custom message,
you can send out product messages where in up to 30 products can be
listed out in a single template and there\'s an add to cart button as
well on the WhatsApp template. You can also send out carousels where in
10 different cards can be shown with 10 different descriptions and
images and their own reply buttons. And a limited time offer template
allows you to have a small countdown timer on your template. Let\'s have
a look at the examples. Here\'s a small example of carousel template.
There are different types of cards that are being showcased, each card
has its own description, its own name and its own reply buttons. So
people can actually browse your different products and services from a
single template and click on buttons they are interested in.

## Bot Studio Tools

After that, we have Bot Studio. Bot Studio has several modules. In the
Journeys section, this is where in you can build two-way interactions.
This is where in you can define the conversations, add block after block
and define the logic what should happen in the conversations. If at all
I click on this drop down, there are three types of journeys: user
journey, campaign journey and ad journey. User journeys where in a user
comes onto the business number in such a manner and they say hi or a
hello and then the bot gets triggered. A campaign journey is the one
where in you send out a WhatsApp campaign and you attach a reply button
to it and there\'s a bot attached to that which is an interactive
campaign. So that is an example of a campaign journey where in a user
enters the bot using a campaign. And then there are ad journeys in which
a person that comes across a click to chat ad on Meta or Instagram or
Google, they can click on that ad and then they can get an option to
send out a WhatsApp message to the business and if at all there\'s a bot
attached to that conversation, a bot can start talking to the person on
the end. Ad journeys works in complement with click to chat ads, where
in all your advertisements can be managed. So all the advertisements are
usually built on Meta and on the Gupshup console, the journey setup, bot
journey setup and the retargeting of messaging can be done. So let\'s
say a person comes across an ad, they can click on an ad and get
redirected onto WhatsApp. But using this particular capability, they can
click onto an ad and get redirected onto WhatsApp and they can talk to a
bot that has been made on the journey builder of Bot Studio. They can
also send out retargeting messages that can be free for them up to 72
hours if at all they go inactive during the conversation.

Here\'s what the journey builder looks like. There are different types
of blocks to support, to make a journey. A journey always starts with a
starting node where in it can start on the basis of an event, can also
be on the basis of AI trigger where in the AI can understand the intent
of a customer directly without saying hi or a hello and then start
assisting them. It can also be on the basis of user input where in you
can simply enter the keyword: hey, hi, hello, whatever. After you setup
the starting node, there are three types of nodes that are used to
orchestrate the journey. Prompt nodes are used for asking questions to
customers, message nodes are used to send out different types of
messages to the customers, whether in you can try to send a PDF file, an
image, an audio file, a button with reply a message with reply buttons,
a list menu. In the actions, you can see different types of actionable
nodes which are used for all the tech orchestration of the journey. So

## Agent Transfer Node

whether it\'s adding delays, adding conditions, transferring somebody to
an agent, moving people from one journey to another journey, all of
these things are possible including API integrations where in you can
always add, delete, update or fetch information from any third party
system provided that they have the APIs.

WhatsApp flows is something which allows people to populate a flow, a
populate a simple form in the WhatsApp chat, which looks something like
this. After one minute, a small form will pop up in this chat, which
looks something like this and the user can start entering their
information. So this is an example of a WhatsApp flow, it obviously has
higher conversion rates and it also has capabilities like multiple
choice answers that people can simply select instead of typing. They can
have their email validated as well, they can enter their phone number
and there\'s also an option for date picker as well, drop downs,
multiple choice answers and all of those functionalities are available
in this form. And it looks a little engaging as well. So that is also a
capability that can be accessed using the Gupshup\'s journey builder.

We also have AI Admin where in AI bots are orchestrated. A bot can be
trained on different types of content, which could be a website link, a
PDF, TXT, CSV file or even text input. Once a website is or once the
content is trained, you can start training the bot using prompts and
define the engagement rules, how is the bot gonna communicate with
users, how is it gonna communicate in case it does not know something,
how is it gonna communicate in case somebody asks rubbish to the bot
which is out of context or which is not related to the use case. All
those functionalities can be defined in the AI Admin workspace. And then
the AI Admin workspace can be called into the journey builder using the
AI node.

We also have Analytics where in users can get a bird\'s eye view of how
many conversations are happening, how many people are engaging, how many
messages are being sent by customers, how many messages are being sent
by bots, what is the total number of messages and similar information in
a graphical manner. And in the conversation path, users can also access
data for a specific journey. These are all the journeys selected for
now. Let\'s zoom into this one. This is where in I can expand this
journey and see the user interactions. So two people entered this
journey, they accessed the list node, then they selected different
different options, this is where in they got separated. Two people
entered this node, one went through this, one went through this. One
directly went to the agent transfer node and one received the text node
and then they exited. Exit node is a pictorial representation of where a
user drops off. Using this, you can define where you need to strengthen
your journey, where you need to strengthen your engagement so that the
exit node numbers become zero. Then you also have journey tracking where
in you can see the journey name, how many total messages are in the
journey, active conversations, average messages per conversation and all
of that. Dropoff nodes, similar data that we saw in the conversational
path is also available in the dropoff nodes. In the AI node, you can see
the total number of utterances, how many of these are unidentified
utterances. That means how many of the prompts or how many user inputs
was the bot trained on, those are identified utterances and if at all
the bot wasn\'t trained on them it could not identify the utterance,
that goes under unidentified utterances. Total FAQs, how many were
answered, how many were unanswered. We also have an API through which
all the unanswered FAQs can be accessed and then the bot can be
retrained for improved accuracy. Instead of commerce bots, product
search and query utterances can also be accessed.

We also have Goal nodes which are used to basically capture the journey
performance and user inputs. So if at all the requirement is to capture
what kind of users are clicking on what kinds of buttons in a in a reply
button or what are they answering, you can simply store that data using
a goal node. If at all I click on analytics, this is how you can see how
many people have achieved a goal, how many of them were unique and you
can also export the data to see what milestones and trackers did they
move from. So you can see if at all there was a five node journey, you
can always track at which point of the journey which phone number is
dropping off. If at all there are lists and menus, what are they exactly
clicking on, all those responses can be accessed using goal nodes.

## User Details Panel

Agents can also populate new information if at all
they collect during the interaction and enter in these fields. All these
fields are totally customizable, they can be specific to the brand\'s
information.

## Canned Responses & Attachments

Agents can also send out attachments, emojis, voice notes.
They can also access AI productivity tools where in they can write a
small phrase and expand it using the expansion tool.

## Rewrite/Expand/Rephrase

They can also
rephrase this particular sentence.

## Chat Summary

They can also have a chat summary of
the entire conversation in case they do not want to go through the
entire chat to save time. Once the chat is handled, they can mark the
priority of the chat, if at all it\'s unresolved, if at all it\'s
resolved. They can also resolve it or they can also transfer it to some
other agent as well.

## Queue Tags / Team Routing

In the settings section, you can define different
types of teams, add different people to different teams. You can also
setup logics to setup assignment rules and route people to relevant
agents as well.

Personalize is something where in customer data can be stored.
Personalize allows you to have a bird\'s eye view of your complete
database. All your data can be accessed in such a manner, you can always
search for a person using their phone number. If at all you click on any
of the profiles, you can see some basic information that they have
already given, maybe in the journey or maybe in the historical data,
some system generated information: when were they first and last active,
when was the profile created and also their event timeline, which tells
you how they are interacting with with the Gupshup console. Was a was
any kind of a campaign sent to them, did they receive did they receive a
message or did they send the message, did they receive a campaign or did
they send a campaign. It can also be based on the basis of external
events as well, where in you can always select a custom integration and
you can also have a look at the at the events that are coming from a
third party which are coming outside of the Gupshup console. It could be
from MoEngage directly from the website or even CleverTap. This is where
in you can select the integration and you can select the event. In the
lists and segments, you can always export and import data onto the
Gupshup console by clicking on list. You can simply enter the name of
the list and upload the CSV file and the data can get updated on the
Gupshup console. You can always create you can also create a new segment
or a cohort to do targeted marketing as well. You can always create a
static segment, create a dynamic segment. If at all I create a dynamic
segment, you can always select what someone has done or not done, what
are the properties about someone, you can filter it on these two bases:
what someone has done or not done. You can select the integration or
let\'s select WhatsApp in this case. You can see whether they have read
a specific message or not like this. You can add a filter and also have
the campaign ID, template ID and template name basis on these you can
also have the filtration and you can simply enter the ID. You can also
make cohorts on the basis of a person\'s profile property, so it can be
on the basis of city, gender or whatever information that you have.
Profile properties allows you to allows you to create profiles to which
are not there on the system. So there are two types of profiles: primary
and custom. Primary are all system generated information and custom
profiles are the ones that you create by yourself. So you can always
create your own specific profile if at all you have any data, extra
data. You can simply enter the profile property name and select the data
type. And the profile property can then be used for storing that
specific data.

Click to chat ads which I covered previously is a module which allows
you to connect advertisements with WhatsApp bot journeys. Integrations
is where in you can define all the integrations, there are few
integrations that are built in. We also have a custom integration where
in you can name the integration something and then start sending events
in in that integration. So let\'s say this is one of the integrations
that we have earlier created. Once you click on create integration, you
can see the callback URL, the authorization token. You can also have an
example of the JSON in which the data needs to be passed in the event
and then you can send out start sending out events in a particular
integration. In the extensions, we have an extension of bot analytics,
goal analytics, all the analytics which are all present in these modules
can also be accessed through the extensions as well. We also have an RCS
extension in which you can do RCS broadcast campaigns as well. And
analyzer and optimizer are the ones in which you can you can basically
have all the information of the reports that you receive after doing a
campaign. Those reports information can be dynamically seen in the
analyzer. So you can see the executive summary, what is the overall
delivery rate, window metrics, template performance, areas of concern.
So all the numbers presented in a more engaging manner. And then the
console also provides few recommendations for practices, what you need
to do and what you should not need to should not be doing to maintain
your campaign numbers. You can also see usage analytics where in you can
see how many messages are you submitting, how many are being sent, how
many are being delivered, what is the delivery rate. So this is your
usage analytics. Message analytics allows you to see total number of
submitted messages, how many are being sent, delivered, read, failed,
button if at all template have buttons how many are being clicked.
Template engagement, similar information based on template engagement.
If at all our messages failing, what are the most frequently facing
error codes that you come across. And spend analytics: how much money
are you spending on on sending out these messages. And window analytics
as well, where in you can see how many people engaged back with a with a
campaign and how many people\'s window were open to send them additional
messages. If at all a person receives a WhatsApp campaign and then they
reply back, a window gets opened for a free flow conversation and
additional free messages can be sent out to the customer. So window
analytics allows you to access that information. Lastly, we have the
manage project project where in you can on the general section see some
basic information. You can also select and start naming your console
whatever you like. You can click on the pencil icon, edit the name and
you can also edit the time zone. Modules allows you to see what all
modules are active on the extension. In the member section, you can
always invite a new member and then you can also control their access:
what kind of module should they be using. If at all it\'s somebody from
the campaign team, they do not need to get access maybe of all the
analytics. Basically it is used for access control. So you can invite
anybody to use the console and then provide them only the module
specific access for privacy. Thanks for watching.
