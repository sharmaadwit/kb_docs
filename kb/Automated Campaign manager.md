## Creating Automated Campaigns

## Date-based Triggers (Reminders)

## Event-based Triggers (Integrations)

## Segment-driven Enrollment

Now let's understand how do we set up automated campaigns. To set up an
automated campaign, we come onto the campaign manager and select
automated. Now you will see a few pre-approved templates like this.
Let's say I select appointment reminder. I select this disclaimer
message and I click on "Use Template". This is wherein you can select
the trigger. So, say for example in this case, it's going to be based on
a date property. I'll select the appointment date, or the which in this
case could be date, and then when should the campaign start? Should the
campaign start on the date, before the date, after the date, or until
the date property value? So, in this case, let's say since this is an
appointment reminder, I'll say before the date property value. Two days,
and at what time? Let's say I'll say 12 p.m.. When to repeat? Only when
the day and month value matches. So, in this case, if at all I have an
appointment on the 15th, I'll get a reminder on the 13th at 12:00 p.m..
And then I can select a template message, and I can select the template
which talks about reminding me that I have an appointment in the next
two days. So, this is how you can set up automated campaigns. Automated
campaigns can also be set up based on what somebody has done or not
done, wherein you can actually select an integration. Or you can also
select it on the basis of segment addition. Let's talk about both of
these. So, in case of integration, let's say if I scroll down, let's
talk, let's imagine that this is one of the integrations that we have
done, and under that integration, this is one of the events that has
happened, let's say sign up. Right. So, now each time a sign up happens,
you can send out a templated message to the customer. You can also
filter this based on based on the payloads as well, where attribute
city, customer ID, or birth date. You can simply click on one of these
attributes and then customize it later on just for further filtration.
In terms of payloads, you can also set up a trigger as segment, wherein
I can say customer 360. And, say for example, each time a person gets
added to a specific segment, you want to enroll them into an automated
campaign. So, how can we do that? We say, "Select what someone has done
or not done". We select the source as customer 360. The condition is
"Added to segment". I can click on "Add Filter," and then I can select
the segment name like this. Now each time a person gets added into this
segment, a templated message can be sent out to this user. So, this is
how you set up automated campaigns. It is majorly used to cover use
cases like birthday wishes, appointment reminders, or any event based
triggers.
